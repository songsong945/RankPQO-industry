The scene then cuts to a quick montage of bizarre images before Ellie wakes up. In the unrated version, after Ellie bites into Jake, she's shown ripping a large chunk of his neck off and then a torrent of blood shoots out of his wound. - In the PG-13 version, after Joanie knocks out Jake she starts looking for Ellie and Jimmy. In the unrated version, she first stops by Kyle's body, digs into the large gash in his stomach with her hands, pulls them out and then licks his blood off her fingers before proceeding to look for Ellie and Jimmy. - In the unrated version, Joanie (in wolf form) is killed when she is shot in the head and her brains slowly ooze onto the floor. - In the PG-13 version, the coroner discovers that Joanie's corpse has changed back into human form when her nude body is shown laying on the floor. In the unrated version, a sheet over her body is pulled back and only her face, complete with a bullet hole in her forehead, is shown. - In the PG-13 version, Jake's death by decapitation occurs off-camera. In the unrated version, Ellie is actually shown stabbing him in the neck with the shovel a couple of times before finally cutting his head off."

It ran 80 minutes. which included about 2 minutes of explanatory remarks and restoration credits, was distributed by Milestone and broadcast on the Turner Classic Movies channel in 2006. The IMDb credits are taken from this version, but they probably differ from the original credits. In 1922, Valentino's screen given name was Rodolph and spelled that way in reviews. Cast lists were not common; credited actors were in the intertitles right before they appeared onscreen. If that were the case for this movie, 'Helen Dunbar' (qv), 'Raymond Brathwayt' (qv) and 'Frank Butler (I)' (qv) would be marked uncredited, since their names and their character names do not appear in the intertitles."

        "The first R-rated cut to be released (October 1981) cut 51 minutes of footage (much of it for continuity purposes) and contained many alternate angles. It had the following changes: - The opening scene is trimmed; instead of panning from the herd of sheep to Caligula and Drusilla lying on the ground, looking at the leaves, then getting up to chase each other, it's simply a cut from the herd of sheep to Caligula and Drusilla getting up. Later in the scene, they cut back to the herd of sheep to hide the cutting of Caligula sucking Drusilla's breast. The final several seconds of the scene are also cut to avoid exposing Drusilla's genitalia. - The scene following the credits is shortened; it cuts from Drusilla saying \"he's not!\" to Macro entering the room. Several shots are juggled around, and Caligula's line \"Macro!\" is moved to a different shot. The final few seconds of the scene are trimmed, calling for a much quicker dissolve than in the original cut. - The start of the scene in which Caligula is being carried to the palace while nude slaves work on the road is trimmed to avoid showing male genitalia. - The scene by Tiberius's pool includes many alternate angles, juggled shots, and rearranged dialogue to avoid showing male genitalia (and a new laugh is dubbed over at the end as Tiberius exits the pool). - The scene in Tiberius's grotto is almost entirely alternate angles in the segments involving the drunk soldier, and in the pleasure building. As well, many shots and lines of dialogue are juggled around. - The scene in which Caligula expresses his fears of being killed by Tiberius to Drusilla, and where he is frightened by a black bird is cut entirely. - In the \"morning at Capri\" scene, several shots exposing genitalia are cut, as is the brief scene of three senators bathing in red mud, and Caligula's fantasies of torturing people. - The entire scene where Charicles explains the condition of Tiberius to Caligula, and in which Macro swears his allegiance to Caligula is cut. - The \"coronation\" scene is trimmed by excluding a brief moment in which Caligula stops in the middle of his speech to sniff a white object in Drusilla's hand. - The two explicit shots of fellatio behind the moon face in Caligula's bedroom are cut. - The entire scene where Caligula \"judges\" a land dispute is cut. - The entire scene where Caligula banishes Ennia and hears about Macro's sentence is cut. - The Temple of Isis scene is trimmed to remove graphic sex, and is shortened; the scene ends with Caligula saying it is \"perfect\" that Caesonia is the most promiscuous woman in Rome. - The \"killing machine\" scene is trimmed to remove all but one quick shot of decapitation. The shot of Macro being beheaded is replaced with a long shot of the same act. Also, the dissolve between this scene and the next is cut. - The rape of Livia and Proculus is drastically shortened-the scene ends on a close-up of Proculus just after Caligula tells Livia to take off her clothes. - The scene where Caligula does his \"little boots\" dance in the rain is shortened to remove nudity. The sex scene between Drusilla, Caesonia, and Caligula (as well as between Messalina and Agrippina) is cut altogether. - The entire sequence with Caligula getting sick, his recovery, as well as when he signs documents and executes Proculus (then sees the black bird again) is deleted, but the shot of the crowd outside the palace is kept, and used as an establishing shot for the next scene. - The scene where Caesonia gives birth is trimmed to remove the exposure of the infant's head coming through the vagina. - The scene where Caligula licks Drusilla's corpse is parially at an alternate angle. - The shot of Caligula wandering the streets with several women crouching in the background was cut. - The scene where Longinus discusses Caligula's whereabouts with Caesonia is cut. - The jail scene is shortened to remove the giant's coin trick. - The Imperial Bordello scene uses many alternate angles, and deletes all but a few seconds of the Guccione inserts. - The Battle of Britain scene is missing a brief conversation between Chaerea and Caligula. - The Celebration scene is shortened to remove shots of pearls mounted in vaginas, and has the end missing; The scene ends just after Caligula shouts \"EAT!\" - Caligula, Caesonia, Julia, and the giant's death scenes are all trimmed to remove more graphic moments (i.e. Julia's head against the stone, closeups of Caligula being stabbed by the guards, etc)."

        "In 1984, Franco Rosselini hired the editor Enzo Micarelli to re-edit a longer, pre-release version of the film for release in Italy, which he re-titled \"Io, Caligola.\" This version ran 133 minutes until the censors forced Rossellini to cut it down, first to 87 minutes, then back to 123 minutes. The ten minutes worth of cuts may explain some of the abrupt changes in music during the most explicit scenes. It contains some alternate angles and a few additional bits not found in the better-known 156 minute \"uncut\" version. As well, some of the music has been replaced with a new score by Renzo Rossellini. This version contains the following differences with the 156 minute version: - The entire film is re-dubbed into Italian. - The prologue of Caligula and Drusilla in the forest is deleted. - The opening credits appear not over the \"bleeding eye\" logo, but over a still from the scene of Tiberius's funeral. The \"Montagues and Capulets\" music in the original has been replaced with a new (more epic-sounding) main theme by Renzo Rossellini. - The opening scene of Caligula awakening in bed with Drusilla, then being scared by a black bird is in its proper place(it appeared about twenty minutes too late in the \"uncut\" version). However, it is missing a couple of lines of dialogue (\"Shh. You're safe. You're with me.\" \"He's going to kill us. Just the way he killed our father, our mother, and our brothers.\"). There are a few additional shots when the bird enters the room (not to mention an amusing new sound effect of the bird crowing), and the entire first part of the scene (up until Caligula gets off the bed) is from an alternate angle/take. After the bird is gone, there is additional dialogue between Caligula and Drusilla where they laugh about it (and Drusilla telling Caligula that \"it's only a bird\" is a different take). Once they're on the bed again, their conversation about Marcellus is gone (causing a jump cut from Caligula fondling her hair to the two of them making out). - A new establishing shot (which appears to have been lensed by Franco Rossellini himself) of the island of Capri is inserted between the scene in Caligula's room and the scene of Caligula being taken to the palace. Therefore, the dissolve between the two scenes is deleted (save a few frames at the end of the first scene that are just barely noticable). - The scene by Tiberius's pool is altered in several places. When he first appears, Tiberius calls out \"Caligula!\" not once (like in the 156 minute version), but twice. During Caligula's dance, the shot of the musicians playing by the pool and the closeup of a boy's ass going underwater are both gone, both without regard for the music track. Part of Claudius's laugh is overdubbed by the Italian actor who dubbed his voice, but part of it sounds like Giancarlo Badessi's original. A shot that depicted one of Tiberius's \"little fishies\" genitals as he kneels is awkwardly cut-it removes the kneeling only, causing a jump cut. Tiberius's dialogue on how he \"protects their innocence\" is cut, meaning that the scene abruptly cuts from him saying \"My little fishies love me\" to the boy and the girl standing beside him jumping into the pool. Some redundant dialogue is cut toward the middle of the scene, so Tiberius now says \"Heaven help Rome when I'm gone! I'm old. All the others, struck down by fate!\", removing the specific references to his remaining choice of heir. The beginning of the shot of Caligula hugging Tiberius is trimmed, so the shot begins with Tiberius patting Caligula on the back. - The grotto scene is also greatly changed. The scene of the drunk soldier being tortured with more wine is cut, as is his subsequent execution. The end of the first cutaway in the 3-story sex building is trimmed, removing the shot of a woman's ass coming forward on a swing. The next cutaway, of a man being masturbated by a woman as reflected through a distorting mirror, is trimmed to remove the display of male genitalia. The closeup of the nymph is gone, but she's still visible and her line of dialogue (\"Britain, lord\") is intact. The two ends of the scene come together well enough that the resulting jump cut is hardly noticeable. The dialogue involving Tiberius asking Caligula whether he prefers \"nymphs to satyrs\" is deleted. The \"More Conviction!\" bit is deleted, and as a result, the exchange between Caligula and Tiberius becomes: Tiberius-\"Rome is a republic, and you and I are plain citizens.\" Caligula-\"Oh, but they love you, lord.\" Tiberius-\"Oh, no. They fear me, and that is much better.\" The closeup of a woman rubbing her genitals is gone, as is Caligula's reaction shot. (It's interesting to note that the long shot of the whole building remains intact here, even though it still shows the soldier being tortured). Some dialogue is cut when Tiberius and Caligula are on the bottom floor, so Tiberius's speech becomes \"We were frugal, good, disciplined and DIGNIFIED! Oh, yes, I am a true moralist. And stern as any cato. Fate chose me to govern swine, and in my old age, I've become a swineherd.\" This also eliminates most of the shots of the freaks on display. The long shot of Gemellus coming down the stairs is deleted, and thus, so is Tiberius's line \"-the setting sun, and the rising moon...\" As Tiberius and Gemellus exit the room, it cuts from Tiberius's line \"...unless he is dead before I am!\" to the cutaway showing the 3-story sex building. This eliminates a line of dialogue from Tiberius, a long shot of the stairs, and Caligula walking over to the podium where Tiberius stamps documents. - The first half of Nerva's suicide is probably the most changed portion of the film. As opposed to the 156 minute version, where Baragli's score filled the soundtrack, the scene is completely without music here. First, the shot of Macro and Ennia coming up to Caligula's room is longer-it shows their shadows against the curtains as they walk towards the entrance. As well, Caligula plays with Ennia's scarf for a few seconds once she is in the room. The beginning of Tiberius's discovery of Nerva's condition is missing-it begins with the long shot of Tiberius saying \"Bind his wrists! Bind his wrists!\" Once Caligula comes over to find out what the commotion is about, a group of guards run across the room. Tiberius's pleading for Nerva to live is both shortened and at an alternate angle. After Nerva says that he hates his life, Ennia and Macro appear, finding Tiberius and Caligula looking on as Nerva dies. There is an exchange of glances, and then Tiberius tells the two senators looking on to leave (a different angle/take), and Caligula chases out Macro and Ennia. The rest of the scene is unchanged (the shot of Caligula entering the room in the 156 minute version is actually the shot of him coming back in after telling Macro and Ennia to leave). - The \"morning at Capri\" scene only shows the guards sleeping, the men waking up on the floor of the grotto, a naked woman in the grotto lying down, and the servants cleaning the walkway. The cuts interrupt the music and sound effects in this scene as well. - Caligula discussing Tiberius's condition begins with Caligula halfway down the stairs. - The scene where Caligula takes the ring from Tiberius's finger has different, almost spaghetti western-sounding music. - During the coronation, there are a few additional reaction shots during the beginning of Caligula's speech of Macro, the priests, Claudius, Gemellus, and Drusilla listening. However, the part where Caligula sniffs an onion to make himself cry is deleted. - The scene where Caligula finds two young guards performing fellatio behind the moonface is reduced to a medium shot of the act, and it goes on for less than two seconds. - The scene where Caligula \"judges\" a land dispute is gone. - All closeups of slaves jerking off for Ennia to use as skin cream are gone, but less than two seconds of a medium shot of the act remains. Caligula's urinating is gone. The cuts disrupt the music in this scene. - The Temple of Isis has been edited quite a bit, and contains completely different music (also, the previous scene ends early, removing Caligula's line \"I wonder what I should wear\"). The scene begins with the main shot of the priestesses rather than the closeups found in the 156 minute version. Almost all shots of the orgy in the pool are gone. Drusilla's line \"Not your style\" immediately cuts to the first closeup of Caesonia. A rotating, overhead shot of the pool is added at the end. - The scene where Caligula and Caesonia have sex for the first time is trimmed. It goes from Caligula turning her on her hands and knees to Caesonia's remark \"You're very convincing as a priestess, Caesar\" (resulting in a jump cut). After Caligula gives his reply, it cuts to the pan away at the end of the scene, only with Caesonia's moan dubbed over it. - The killing machine opens not with the closeup of a man being decapitated, as in the 156 minute version, but with the overhead shot of the blades as the machine moved along. The only shot of decapitation retained is that of the second prisoner. Macro's decapitation is completely left to the imagination. It shows people throwing fruit at him, then suddenly, Caligula says his famous \"just one neck\" comment. Interestingly, one remark from the crowd (\"What's it feel like now, Macro?\") is left in English. What follows is a scene deleted entirely from the 156 minute version-As Caligula begins to talk to Longinus about Proculus, it suddenly cuts to a long shot of the imperial box, then it shows the guards going over to Proculus's seat and throwing him into the stadium with the killing machine. Proculus kills all the guards on the killing machine until he gets to the top. Once he's there, Caligula salutes him as a Roman hero, sending him a crown of flowers. - The wedding scene is trimmed both to pick up the pace, and to make the film less graphic. Caligula asking Proculus if Livia is a virgin is gone, as is him throwing his clothes over her and commenting on how she's lucky to lose her virginity to a descendant of Venus. Caligula's noticing the blood from her genitals, saying that she really was a virgin, and asking Proculus if he is one is all cut, covered by the use of a shot of Livia laying on her side, which was actually used later in the scene in the 156 minute version (causing a jump cut). Caligula does ask Proculus to take off his clothes, but once he gets him on the table, it suddenly cuts to him saying \"My blessing to you both\", and putting the flower in his ass. - The scene where Caligula, Drusilla, and Caesonia make love is almost completely different in tone. All of Bob Guccione's inserts depicting two lesbian models making love are gone, but the shots of the moon face that segue into them are intact. The scene now begins with the ladies-in-waiting sitting down, then cutting to Caligula and Drusilla kissing, then Caligula fondling her breasts, then it cuts to the shot of Caesonia and Drusilla kissing, then panning down. The scene ends there, and it contains an entirely different, and decidedly more ominous music score. - The beginning of the scene in Incitatus's stable is missing. - The scene where Caligula is ill is simplified-when Caligula asks for Drusilla, she comes, and THEN they have their conversation about how they quarrel. All the dialogue dealing with the conspirators planning for Caligula's death, as well as Caligula making out his will, is gone. - Proculus's death is intact up to the point where he is urinated on, that is cut. Caligula tells Longinus to cut off Proculus's genitals, and then he walks away. End of scene. - The birth of Julia Drusilla is edited to remove the actual shots of a woman giving birth. - Drusilla's death is edited. Instead of Caligula licking her corpse, it shows him licking her feet, and then jump cuts to him coming back up after licking her whole body. The final shot of the scene is completely different-the 156 minute version shows Caligula walking around the palace screaming \"NO!\". \"Io, Caligola\" shows a red-tinted scene of him carrying her corpse on the veranda. - The scene of Caesonia asking Longinus where Caligula is is deleted here. - The scene in the jail begins with Caligula coming down the chute. The scene of the giant doing a coin trick with a woman's vagina is deleted. - The imperial bordello scene is almost unrecognizable. The shots of the senators wives looking scared are deleted. Bits and pieces of Guccione's inserts are presented at seemingly random points, all with a nearly completely different music score (the piece from Cinderella is still intact, but it carries over to the next scene). - The scene of Caligula walking around the palace at night has two inserts of the moon that are not present in the 156 minute version. - The film ends with a still of Incitatus running away, rather than the closeup of Caligula's dead face. The new theme runs over the credits."

Many of the scenes are shuffled in order and are much re-edited, and of most note is that much of the original dialogue is dubbed with especially recorded alternate versions, with much stronger swearing (including several instances of the \"f\" word) Some elements of the story (generally ones that would continue as threads in the TV series) are completely eliminated. Various differences include: - The opening credits captions are different, running slower. - A different version of the theme tune is played on the opening sequence. - Archangel discussing with the Senator the development of Airwolf (which gives much of the project's background) is much abridged. - Shots of Airwolf's on-board radar and maintanance screens are completely different. - Numerous scenes have different backing scores and sound effects. - A couple of close-ups of the photos in Hawke's cabin are of completely different photos to the original version. - For some reason, (most of) the story behind the paintings adorning the walls in Hawke's cabin is removed. - On the TV version, before Moffet and his crew head off to Libya in Airwolf, they destory a fighter jet over the desert. On the video version, there is a completely different version of the effectivley the same scene, with them destroying three figher jets over the ocean. - Asides from adding much stronger language, the video release also for some reason also changes numerous lines of dialogue. For pure example, when Hawke tells Dominic that he's got a tough mission for the pair of them, Dominic quips \"What're we gonna do, kidnap Kadaffi?\"; the TV version's \"Nothing that simple\" becomes \"No, a helicopter\". There's numerous other instances of lines of dialogue being changed. - The closing credits are (slightly) different. - The whole chunk of story of where Hawke and Dominic find a hiding place for Airwolf for after they retreive it (in a hollow mountain) and the whole last few minutes after Hawke's recovered & hidden Airwolf, and saying he'll only return it if the Firm find solid information on his missing brother, are completely gone. - The video version finishes (rather abruptly) with Hawke and Dominic having defeated Moffet, flying off over the ocean into the sun-set (in a piece of footage used on the TV episode 'Mad Over Miami') and the film finishing; as opposed to the TV version which has several more minutes with Hawke and Archangel discussing the return of Airwolf on condition that Hawke's brother is found, then Hawke going back out to the lake to play his cello. - Interestingly, there is a scene where twisted creator Dr. Moffet is torturing the kidnapped Gabrielle in the desert, that was in the original TV version but not on this release. This scene is quite strong and as a result is often edited out by many TV showings; considering the stronger nature of the video version, it's surprising it was not included. As this scene is not on the video release and is often cut out on TV, it could be considered to be quite rare"

Another change concerning Jones the cat: when Ripley encounters the Alien in the corridor having just set the self-destruct sequence, instead of the Alien looking curiously at Jones in his cat box, it gives him a brief glance before violently swatting the box aside.

In the work print he takes two bloody bullet hits in the back and then there is another shot of 3 more coming out of his chest and as he falls to the ground you can see another shot of him from behind taking another 3 hits before hitting the ground. - In the R rated version Evan is fired upon and doesn't appear to be hit until Frank finds him later. In the work print Kynette forces Travers shoot at Evan you then see Evan take a bullet through the shoulder in slow-motion which explains why he appears to have been shot when Frank finds him later on. - The fight between Gabe and Kynette has been shortened for the R rated version which misses shots of Gabe and Jessie being beaten further after Kynette asks for the *third* time where the money is (this is missing in the R rated version which leads to a continuity error as he said he would ask three times)The impaling of Kynette has been shortened, in the work print there is more focus on Kynette's eyes going back into his head and Gabe gritting his teeth holding Kynette up on the stalagmite as he is dying before finally dropping him. - When Hal and Delmar fight the R rated version has removed a shot of Delmar kicking Hal hard in the kidneys and saying \"Tell me how are we feeling so far?\" as opposed to the R rated version \"Tell me do you like soccer\" they have been edited together and this now explains why Delmar appears out of breath when he asks the soccer question. - When Hal shoots Delmar with the shotgun in the work print you see Craig Fairbrass get shot with a large splatter of blood behind him and a bloody shotgun wound to his chest as he dives off the mountain. The R rated version shows a different angle with a stuntman falling off the mountain. Additionally the work print shows Delmar's body slamming into the rocks below where as the R rated version cuts away just before. - When Qualen shoots Kristel in the work print all three bloody bullet impacts are shown, in the R rated version it cuts away after the first shot to show Traver's reaction. - The Gabe and Travers fight has been edited (this might not be censorship, apparently the filmmakers decided it would be better to have Gabe shoot Traver's with his piton gun before falling under the ice as per the R rated version) in the work print Gabe shoots Traver's once with the piton gun and Traver's gets up and tries to shoot Gabe through the ice and is then shot by Hal three times with a shotgun before falling under the ice (this explains why Hal appears with a shotgun in the R rated version). - The ending fight with Gabe and Qualen has been shortened so kidney punches, an arm break and a longer shot of a terrified Qualen crashing to his death in the helicopter were taken out."

A shot of a cutting torch being picked up just after the main logo is missing. Two Face's reply after the guard says \"You said you'd let me live\" is missing. After the 'punctual funeral' line, Two Face shouting \"Kill the Bat!\" has been removed from the soundtrack and replaced with music and guards grunting. When the elevator dings just before Batman exits, Two Face's shout of \"Blast him!\" was not present in the UK version. The fight outside the elevator has lost a lot of sound effects, as well as a sequence where Batman drops his leg sharply onto a thug's chest, complete with a loud thud. Batman delivering a backward head butt and breaking a thug's nose in extreme close-up has been removed. Close-ups of kicks to midriffs and faces are also missing. Two Face's lines in the helicopter about the acid have been removed. In the sequence where the helicopter pilot is killed, Two Face emptying an entire clip into the helicopter pilot has been trimmed, along with shots showing the bullets riddling the pilot's body from the front. The cut UK version had only three shots fired, and the pilot is shown slumping from behind. The death of Stickley does not show him stopping on the window ledge, and hanging in terror, before Nygma runs over and says \"Fred, babe! You are fired! Or should I say...terminated?\". With this, he pulls the hat off him and he falls down, but this was all cut from the UK print. Two Face's line in the circus big top was cut from the UK version, \"Our new act for your personal amazement: we call it - Massacre Under The Big Top!\". A shot of Nygma laughing at the above line is also missing. When the Mayor asks what Two Face wants at the circus, his reply is shortened from \"Batman - bruised, broken, bleeding. In a word, dead!\" to simply \"Batman\". The UK version is missing the sequence where Bruce Wayne kills one guard on the right side of the big drum by coming up behind him, breaking his neck, and smacking him in the face as he falls. When Two Face flips his coin before killing the Graysons, after his evil laugh he goes on to say \"Their kind of day\", which was missing in the UK version. As the bomb is raised through the roof of the circus, a quick sequence of Bruce flipping a guard over and kicking him hard in the gut is missing. When Two Face accidentally kills two of his men in the car, their screams have been cut short in the UK version, and a shot of the driver's terrified face has been removed. The fight at Nygma's party loses some impact sounds. Shortly after this, Batman makes a guard do the splits and another crack accompanies this, but the sound has virtually been eliminated from the soundtrack. A small crack has been greatly reduced in volume as Batman twists a thug's arm backwards Robin throwing Two Face a vicious head butts after the line, \"This is for me!\" has been replaced in the UK version, by removing the punch Robin throws after he says \"This is for my brother\" and reinserting in place of the head butt."

Then they stop when Burt says he left something back at the store and they have a longer conversation about the map. - The scene of Rider Strong going behind the building to wash his hands after Dennis's bite and he pets the stray dogs is removed from the \"uncut\" version. - A different angle of Jordan Ladd's character Karen swimming away after the \"kiss\" scene on the dock with Rider Strong. - When it is discovered that Karen has the disease during an intimate scene, there is an additional scene that follows the \"Don't...Leave...Me!\" where Burt comes into the room and yells at her about how the truck isn't ready yet, and they have to finish cleaning up the bum's blood. - An extended scene of everyone arguing around the fireplace when Burt makes a joke about his burnt marshmallow. - A scene of Burt sitting outside guarding the shed with his shot gun. This immediatly follows when they hear the dog trying to get Karen in the shed and they shoot a bullet and tell Karen that they will stay outside with her to keep the dog away. - The gunshot to Burt's head in the cabin is bloodier. In the \"R\" rated version it cuts away quick and only shows the aftermath from a difficult-to-see angle. - An additional scene where Rider Strong grabs the long-haired hick after the attack and drags him down to the celler. He yells at the hick as he throws him down there and says \"When they get here, tell them I didn't do it!\", then slams the door. - The human-bonfire scene when they say \"We got another one in the basement\" immediatly goes to a shot of the celler door opening from the inside, then a bunch of shotguns appear and start shooting like crazy. We see blood all over the walls. Then they pour gasoline and one cop lights a match and celler goes up in flames followed by more shots of blood and guts on the walls, ceiling, and floor. - The end is switched around a little. Instead of just the cops drinking the contaminated lemonade followed by a country song with the townspeople, the whole entie town shows up and has a cup. There is additional dialoug amoung the townspeople, different shots, and it shows the FDA man walking around more testing and the Water supply truck is in view longer. - That is every scene that is changed or cut from the Lions Gate release."

This is most noticeable in Season 4, where 7 of the 22 episodes have some type of edit. The German region 2 Season 4 set uses non-syndicated versions of these episodes, although the Dutch and French sets have the syndicated versions. The DVD box sets from Season 3 onward do not feature the original \"Love and Marriage\" theme song in the opening sequence. This was done because Sony was unable to obtain the rights to the theme song. It is highly unlikely that the theme song will return in any yet to be released DVD box set. The replaced theme song was the cause of the syndicated versions of seven episodes in Season 4, as Sony falsely claimed did not have access to the original masters of these episodes, and had to use syndicated prints. This is proved wrong since they used the originals from Season 4 in \"Most Outrageous\" DVDs that contained some episodes. As the end credits had to be altered to credit the new theme song, certain scenes that originally ran during the end credits had to be replaced with a freeze frame. In most episodes affected, the original audio plays in the background while you see a freeze frame, however in a few cases a freeze frame is used, but the original audio is replaced with the theme song."

They are ambushed by Nazis, who kill the two spies before Cap finishes them all off. Cap then holds the dying female spy in his arms and is reminded of his girlfriend, Bernie, back in the United States. - There is an additional scene which explores the character of the Red Skull more, and it attempts to make him look much more like a tragic figure, haunted by his painful past. In the 1990's, as Steve Rogers is reviewing the deaths of Martin Luther King and John Kennedy and realizing that the Red Skull is to blame, the Red Skull is shown weeping over the piano seen at the end of the film, re-living the visitation of the Italian army storming into his house, shooting his family, and kidnapping him for their experiments.

This changes the feel of the entire scene--as though they were suggesting that Soundwave is attempting to discover the secrets of transforming (while he himself is transformed, mind you). - They dubbed in a new swoosh sound as Soundwave lunges for Spike. - In the scene change from Soundwave retreating to Prime spotting him, the animation takes on a strange greenish hue while it's inside the computer window.  I think the computer animators forgot to adjust their tint settings; once the window goes away, the colors of the scene are restored. - When Prime is dangling on the ledge inside the power plant and Megatron asks if he has any last words, when Prime says, \"None you'd wanna hear, Megatron!\" they used an inset of Prime's head.  The problem is, they took it from a later scene when he's back outside, so it's got a blue sky background. - They also added a fizzling sound when Megatron steps on Prime's hand. - The \"green screen\" effect happens again when Prime grabs Jazz's grappling cord. At the end, during the preview for part 3, they sampled the sound effect of Hound creating the holographic rocket base and reused it for the scene of Prime being blasted out of the sky by the Decepticon space cruiser. - The voice credits are from \"More Than Meets the Eye\" this time, but there is no mention of 'Welker, Frank' (qv)."

He runs off screen and we see him get distracted by a brightly colored dishrag.

The 2002 DVD omits this credit & the Walt Disney Pictures Presents credit stays on screen. - The animation in some of the scenes went back through the clean-up animation department a second time, to correct problems such as wavering lines and missing details, which, while not very noticeable during a traditional 35mm showing of the film, would have been discomforting on a much large IMAX screen. Small details, such as the blood in Beast's wound after his fight with the wolves, were also added. - The Beast's \"stutter\" (\"You wan-wanna stay in the tower?\"), a sound editing mistake, was corrected (\"You wanna stay in the tower?\"). - Six minutes of new footage was added between the songs \"Something There\" and \"Beauty and the Beast,\" most of which is made up of a new musical sequence, \"Human Again.\" This song was written by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken for the original version of the film, but cut for continuity purposes. After Alan Menken altered the song to make it work for the Broadway stage version of Beauty and the Beast, the song was worked back into the film. - During the \"Human Again\" song sequence, the household objects clean up the Beast's castle, which necessitated having the background artists go back and digitally re-paint the backgrounds for the castle scenes that followed so that the castle was clean. - The animation for Cogsworth's line to the Beast after Belle is freed (\"Yes-yes-yes, but...why?\") was completely re-done, as the directors never liked how the animation looked in the original version. - New sound effects are added to the shot where Belle and Phillippe leave the castle to find Maurice, which are supposed to suggest that the Beast trashes his room in anguish (and also so that the backgrounds from this point on would not have to be repainted). - The longer credits necessitated the addition of an additional passage of score music, the version of the 'Transformation' theme that was cut out of the original film, to the end of the film."

The musical score is the original Vladimir Kraus-Rajteric score which kicks in very rarely. The scenes are rearranged so that Welles makes his speech to the troops near the beginning and the air attack hits Bihac simultaneously with the land battle. Almost every dialog scene is lengthened and cut slower than the English version, but there are some parts of the action scenes cut a lot tighter. For instance, this is missing the scene where Riva falls out of the truck during the Italian retreat. It is also missing the scene in the Orthodox church prior the Welles addressing the Chetniks. However, it does feature several new scenes, most notably a scene where Vasco raids a house in Prosor only to then shoot and wound his own commander, and then a second battle between the Partisans and the Italians. In this scene, Riva refuses to fire at his own men and Novak almost shoots him only for Martin to intervene. General Morelli is captured and then promptly commits suicide with a pistol. There is also a new scene where the partisans surprise attack a group of Chetniks guarding the Neretva bridge. There are several more violent shots missing from other prints - such as the Ustashans hanging an old woman and laughing when they march through Bihac. There are several more deaths during the end battle with the Chetniks such as a partisan being shot in the back when reaching for a grenade. Then at the end of the battle there is a scene where a partisan named 'Stipe' goes crazy and guns down a number of Chetnik prisoners, only to have his rank stripped from him. Curiously almost all the nationalities speak their own language; with Riva speaking Italian even with his Yugoslavian captors and Morelli speaking in German when addressing General Lohring. The only actors dubbed appear to be Yul Brynner and Orson Welles."

Ethel offers some homemade cookies for Lucy, but Ricky explains that Lucy is worried about her figure, and would like to go on a diet. The three then remember the last time Lucy went on a diet. This leads into the opening scene of \"The Diet\". This flashback scene has been restored for the 2002 DVD release of \"I Love Lucy\"."

In the work print he takes two bloody bullet hits in the back and then there is another shot of 3 more coming out of his chest and as he falls to the ground you can see another shot of him from behind taking another 3 hits before hitting the ground. - In the R rated version Evan is fired upon and doesn't appear to be hit until Frank finds him later. In the work print Kynette forces Travers shoot at Evan you then see Evan take a bullet through the shoulder in slow-motion which explains why he appears to have been shot when Frank finds him later on. - The fight between Gabe and Kynette has been shortened for the R rated version which misses shots of Gabe and Jessie being beaten further after Kynette asks for the *third* time where the money is (this is missing in the R rated version which leads to a continuity error as he said he would ask three times)The impaling of Kynette has been shortened, in the work print there is more focus on Kynette's eyes going back into his head and Gabe gritting his teeth holding Kynette up on the stalagmite as he is dying before finally dropping him. - When Hal and Delmar fight the R rated version has removed a shot of Delmar kicking Hal hard in the kidneys and saying \"Tell me how are we feeling so far?\" as opposed to the R rated version \"Tell me do you like soccer\" they have been edited together and this now explains why Delmar appears out of breath when he asks the soccer question. - When Hal shoots Delmar with the shotgun in the work print you see Craig Fairbrass get shot with a large splatter of blood behind him and a bloody shotgun wound to his chest as he dives off the mountain. The R rated version shows a different angle with a stuntman falling off the mountain. Additionally the work print shows Delmar's body slamming into the rocks below where as the R rated version cuts away just before. - When Qualen shoots Kristel in the work print all three bloody bullet impacts are shown, in the R rated version it cuts away after the first shot to show Traver's reaction. - The Gabe and Travers fight has been edited (this might not be censorship, apparently the filmmakers decided it would be better to have Gabe shoot Traver's with his piton gun before falling under the ice as per the R rated version) in the work print Gabe shoots Traver's once with the piton gun and Traver's gets up and tries to shoot Gabe through the ice and is then shot by Hal three times with a shotgun before falling under the ice (this explains why Hal appears with a shotgun in the R rated version). - The ending fight with Gabe and Qualen has been shortened so kidney punches, an arm break and a longer shot of a terrified Qualen crashing to his death in the helicopter were taken out."

The sequence involves Lucy telling Ricky that instead of watching TV, they will read a murder mystery. Then Desi reminds Lucy what happened the last time she read a murder mystery. This leads into the opening scene of \"Lucy Thinks Ricky Is Trying To Murder Her\". This flashback scene has been restored for the 2002 DVD release of \"I Love Lucy\"."

Disney could not locate any film footage of this number, but they found the audio tracks and still photographs of the number. The restoration team created a still-photo recreation to include as a supplement; it has appeared on most home video versions of the 139-minute cut. Because it was done on tape and because it was decided audiences might find the switch from live action to still photos jarring, it was left out of the film's reconstruction. The \"Film Facts\" supplement of the 30th Anniversary DVD claims it was there, but the BBFC's listing for the film, dated August 11, 1971, lists its running time as 117 minutes, 5 seconds. The song sequence itself is 2 minutes, 30 seconds, making it unlikely that the premiere screening had the song."

After that a scene has been added where Salieri and Mozart visits Cavalieri in her lodge. Caterina throws some surly remarks about Constanze before she too comes and asks that she and Mozart go home. Mozart walks out on Caterina, and the scene goes to Salieri saying that he knew Mozart \"had had her\". - When Salieri asks \"What was God up to?\", the monologue has been extended, with Salieri speculating that it might be a test by God. - After Salieri admits to have started to hate Mozart, a shot has been inserted of Salieri praying, asking that Mozart be sent to Salzburg. This is immediately followed by the shot of the archbishop telling Leopold that he won't take Mozart back. - After Mozart refuses to submit his work for the royal appointment, a scene has been added showing Wolfgang and Constanze arguing. This establishes that the couple is in need of money. - When Constanze goes to visit Salieri in secret, the scene has been extended, starting with Salieri teaching a student. - The biggest addition comes after Constanze asks if Salieri will help them; instead of just walking out on her, he says says that she must come to his place, alone in the evening, strongly implying they must have sex for him to recommend Mozart's on the committee. - The scene switches to Salieri praying at his clavichord as Constanze arrives. She begins to undress, with Salieri looking shocked. When she is half-nude, Salieri calls in his valet and tells him to escort Constanze out. Humiliated and furious she throws a candelabra after him. Wolfgang finds Constanze crying in bed at home. This explains why Constanze is so eager to throw Salieri out of her home at the end of the movie. - Another large section is added where Salieri implies to the emperor that Mozart has been molesting young female students. This results in someone else getting the royal appointment. Mozart comes to see Salieri, receiving the news. Mozart asks Salieri for a loan, again establishing that he needs money. Salieri recommends Mozart give lessons to a Herr Schlumberg's daughter. The lesson however turns out a major frustration for Mozart, with Herr Schlumberg's dogs howling and causing a ruckus. - A scene has been added where Salieri and Baron Van Swieten discuss Mozart's financial difficulties. This is followed by a shot of a drunken Mozart again visiting Herr Schlumberg, asking if he may give lessons and - when denied - asks for a loan. That request is denied as well."

Mai-Lee accidently hurts Kathryn while doing her toe nails and Kathryn yells at her in Vietnamese - a third scene is from the end of the movie, when Kathryn and Annette meet each other in the bathroom of Manchester. Only a minor change of dialogue takes place here though - finally and most interestingly there is the alternate ending scene. Sebastian still gets hit by a car, but not because of saving Annette. He just stops fighting when he sees her standing across the street and gets hit when he crosses it.

Director 'Peter Jackson (I)' (qv) decided to use the extra time to apply some additional spit and polish to the film, resulting in a new cut approximately seven minutes shorter than the original (97 minutes vs. 104 minutes). This cut premiered at the Toronto Film Festival and was eventually released in the U.S. (along with an emasculated, 85-minute R-rated version).

To fit the existing color footage to the uncut soundtrack, some shots are repeated. - Before Pike's line \"Don't help me. . . They can't read through hate\", the Keeper exits the menagerie. After that line, a shot from a later scene of the Keeper returning is re-used. This was made to cover up the dissolve to the later scene that was made for \"The Menagerie\" (1966). Originally, this shot followed a closeup to Veena, a cut to the Enterprise bridge, and a cut to the prisoners asleep in the cage. All of that was ruined (maybe permanently) by the dissolve made in 1966. - After Pike beams back to the ship, there is a reaction shot of Number One and Spock. The color print of this shot was lost, so what is used instead is a re-photographed shot of the shot played on the view screen (taken from \"The Menegerie, part II\"). This is evident because the shot begins to pull back and we can see the edge of the monitor screen.

Ince (Viggo Mortensen) saluting his son (played by his real son), Marichek, and others. - Interspersed with the previous extended leaving scene is the submarine movie trivia game on the bus with a few added lines about an invalid question and one owing the other money. - Hunter's jogging scene before the fire is slightly extended. - After the drill, in the Captains cabin, Ramsey asks Hunter to speak to COB about his weight, stating a personal aversion to doing it because they've served together so long. He then makes the 'WWIII, ship being sunk, giant octopus\" statement. - Just before encountering the Akula for the first time while getting an EAM, COB reports to Hunter's cabin while Hunter is shaving. Hunter says that the subject is uncomfortable. COB, almost jovial, says he knows he's overweight, but this is his last patrol and he can't stop eating. They laugh. COB tells Hunter that he thinks Hunter and Ramsey merely have a difference of management styles. Then they go get something to eat. - Just before the Akula launches torpedoes after the winch noise, a comment is made that the Akula is 'range gating' and the sonar tech asks 'What is range gating?' and another says 'It means they have their torpedoes locked on us, stupid!' - During the explosion of the second torpedo (while Ramsey is still in command), an additional shot of a crewman falling down a ladder is added. - We see Rivetti leave sonar, saying 'I've gotta take a whiz' when he goes to release Hunter. - We see COB going into the Naval Inquiry, with Zimmer leaving very upset. COB then leaves, head down. Next, Ramsey is called into the inquiry. All the while we see Hunter waiting. Then he is called in. - The Admiral asks Hunter if he thinks his recollection of the events differs from his Captain's, just before saying 'I have known Capt Ramsey'... etc. - Although the overall score is intact, several scenes had different arrangements."

The film was formally resubmitted to the Classification Board in 1989, who re-affirmed the ban. An appeal saw the film's ban lifted and an R18+ rating issued. This version was released on the CBS/Fox home video label. This home video version's opening credits, and the climax featuring Z-Man shooting a woman in her bed, were re-edited.

This cut was re-edited by Coppola and Walter Murch and features a new Technicolor dye prints with additional footage originally left out of thetheatrical release. The new version is 197 minutes long (53 minutes longer than the original version). The restored footage also includes the French plantation scenes with Aurore Clement and Christian Marquand, as well as scenes from the crew meeting the Playmates later on. - There are additional scenes when the crew is with Kilgore. During the napalm strike, he helps a wounded Vietnamese child. The napalm strike has ruined the favorable surfing conditions, so Lance and the others leave, much to Kilgore's dismay. Before they leave, Willard steals Kilgore's surfboard. Finally, just before Willard and Chef leave the boat to search for mangoes, a helicopter files by with Kilgore on loudspeaker, asking for his surfboard back. - In the Playmate scenes, Willard trades two drums of oil in exchange for spending two hours with the Bunnies. We see Chef with Miss May in a helicopter, and Lance with the Playmate of the Year in a ransacked house. Miss May was once a bird trainer at Busch Gardens and tries to talk about birds with Chef while he is busy trying to get her to re-enact her photo that he showed the crew. They end up kissing and Miss May gets excited because Chef kisses like a bird. The Playmate of the Year is talking to Lance about her troubles and insecurities about being a Playmate. Clean is seen trying to barge in on both men, and when he barges in on Lance, the Playmates open a chest (in which to hide) and discovers a dead Vietnamese. Lance comforts her. Chef finds out afterwards that Clean is a virgin and starts calling him names on the boat. Willard told Chief that the whole crew can spend time with the Bunnies, but Chief refuses. - At the plantation, Chef figures that they are French first and tells them in French that they are Americans and are friends. They bury Clean with his tape player there, and eat dinner with the French. The crew eats with the staff, and Willard eats with the family. Chef wants to speak to the chef but is informed he only speaks Vietnamese. Willard is lectured about France's colonial history in Indochine as well as their military blunders. There also is a scene with Willard and Roxanne, one of the French women, smoking opium. - At the Kurtz compound, Willard is imprisoned in an oven-like box. Kurtz appears, accompanied by a group of children. He reads to Willard from Time magazine articles about the Vietnam War."

After they leave the Ricardos, there is a montage of scenes showing the Mertzs going into the dining car and being escorted to a table on the second floor of the car where the dome viewing area is. All subsequent airings of this episode omit the scene but a rare 16MM print of the episode, with the scene intact, restored it for the season five DVD release of the show in 2005. The scene was cut from television airings because it was out of sequence with the story. If you look closely at the domed windows of the dining car, you can clearly see the reflections of lights passing over them, simulating a train that is moving at a pretty good speed. However, this scene was placed in the show at a time when the train that the Ricardos and the Mertzes were on had not even left Union Station in Los Angeles. After the Mertzes are seen in the domed dining car of the moving train, the station master announces the departure of their train from the station along with a shot of the train pulling away from the platform in a later scene.

Lambert tells Ripley, Parker and Brett how the face hugger got on Kane. - Ripley radios down to Parker and Brett to see how they're progressing on the repairs, Parker and Ripley exchange tense words over the radio. - After the face hugger's acid eats through a few floors, the crew returns to the med lab to check up on Kane's condition.  Ripley sees an X-Ray of Kane's chest and asks Ash, \"What is that dark stain on Kane's lung?\"  The rest of the crew starts asking if Kane's going to live, Dallas tells everyone to go back to work. - After Kane's death, the crew gathers around at the meal table to discuss what they're going to do with the escaped alien.  Brett announces the cattle-prod idea and suggests \"catching\" the alien in a net. - Longer version of Brett's death.  This scene had Brett frozen with fear as the alien grabs his head, he yells \"Parker!\" and then blood poors from beneath his cap.  The alien lifts him up into the landing gear and Ripley and Parker come rushing in.  Parker stands where Brett once was and looks up; blood drips on his shirt and then Brett's cattle prod falls to Parker's feet. - Part of a scene that involves Parker, Ripley and Lambert trying to flush the alien out of the air lock.  As they are about to succeed, an alarm is triggered and the alien rushes out of the airlock (getting its tail caught in the closing door, and spilling acid that causes a hull breach).  Parker falls unconciously to the floor, Ripley does the same and Lambert and Ash come to their rescue.  Ripley vocalizes her suspicions about Ash by accusing him of setting the alarm off. - After Dallas's disappearance, Ripley (being suspicious of Ash) asks Lambert if she's ever slept with him. - The build-up to Lambert's death is much longer.  (Watch the alien's shadow on the wall, it walks in, crouches down, then immediately gets up) A scene where we see the alien enter, crouch down and wait until Lambert notices its presence was cut.  When Lambert sees the alien, it uncoils its tail and walks (like a crab) over to Lambert. - After Ripley discovers the remains of Parker and Lambert, she makes another discovery.  Ripley enters the landing gear area of the Nostromo (where Brett got killed) and discovers a cocooned Dallas and Brett mutating into an egg. Dallas pleads, \"Kill me\".  Ripley flames Dallas and the Brett-egg and then runs to set the ship on self-destruct."

It reveals that Grace teaches English to the Na'vi children until a serious incident came about (bullet holes around, etc..) which was insinuated about. - Jake and Neytiri tripping through the neon-light woods is slightly longer. - When Jake joins the circle, a little Na'vi girl smiles at him curiously, but her father holds her back. Neytiri then arrives and hands Jake a fruit. - Jake tries to ask Neytiri her name, but she seems annoyed by that. - Jake, Grace and Norm proceed from the helicopter to the secluded laboratory. There's an explanation about the mountains. - At night, Jake and Neytiri run through the luminescent forest. - After Jake touches the Fan Lizard, it flies away in a radiant glow. Its fellow species follow suit and, to the delight of Jake and Neytiri, raise themselves into the air. - As Jake and the other Na'vi climb the mountain, Neytiri flies past them on a Seze. - The Na'vi goes for an aerial hunt for Stuurmbeast. Jake shoots one and exclaims in excitement. Neytiri follow suit as well. - The Na'vi destroy the Hell Trucks of the mining company. - The next morning, Wainfleet's squad sifts through the remains of the Hell Trucks. Turns out that Na'vi kill the soldiers as well. Quaritch and Selfridge watch the live broadcast. - Tsu'tey's fall from the sky is longer. A few plants decelerate and break his fall. - The Hammerhead Titanotheres has been extended. - The fight between Neytiri on a Thanathor and Quaritch is slightly longer. - Tsu'Tey's death: he knows he is dying and appoints Jake to be his successor. He insists Jake to kill him because by Na'vi customs, Jake has to pass him to the Eywa by killing him by his own hands. Neytiri starts to cry. Jake reluctantly complies with his wish, stabbing him by the knife as the camera passes by him. - The end credits has an addition of using Discovery Zone's Bless the Plague soundtrack.

Taking a cue from classic movie epics, the opening reels now set up the basic themes with greater economy: Alexander's Oedipal relationship with his parents, Olympias' ambitions for her son, the boy's need to surpass his father, and the entirely natural way in which myth/religion is shown as integral to the ancients' behavior. Oliver Stone reworked the third act, juxtaposing events in India and Greece. And Jolie's Olympias emerged more as a genuinely pathetic figure in the whole tragedy. Stone wanting to isolate her character's own ambition from the one person she loves. Ptolemy's final scene was edited.

After they leave the Ricardos, there is a montage of scenes showing the Mertzs going into the dining car and being escorted to a table on the second floor of the car where the dome viewing area is. All subsequent airings of this episode omit the scene but a rare 16MM print of the episode, with the scene intact, restored it for the season five DVD release of the show in 2005. The scene was cut from television airings because it was out of sequence with the story. If you look closely at the domed windows of the dining car, you can clearly see the reflections of lights passing over them, simulating a train that is moving at a pretty good speed. However, this scene was placed in the show at a time when the train that the Ricardos and the Mertzes were on had not even left Union Station in Los Angeles. After the Mertzes are seen in the domed dining car of the moving train, the station master announces the departure of their train from the station along with a shot of the train pulling away from the platform in a later scene. Union Pacific Railroad provided Desilu Productions with assistance for several scenes in this episode."

A slightly longer opening sequence on the model's runway where a skinny audience members mumbles \"I both love it and I hate it\" before the first model blimps up. - 2. In the first Tender Loins sequence, there is new footage starting with a conversation with the bartender and Persephone about her new boyfriend, whose brother she is going to meet. The boyfriend shows up and his brother is revealed to be his Siamese twin with an inexplicable British accent and snooty, patrician attitude. The manager then panics because Erotica hasn't shown up for work. This segues into a sequence where Erotica as Stripperella (This is Stripperella's (And Erotica's)first appearance in the two-parter, NOT the reveal of Erotica as she starts her act in the Tender Loins, as it is in the single episode version) rescues a baby from the lion's pit at a zoo. Giving the baby to its mother she is thanked but griped at because she destroyed the baby's heirloom blanket. She then talks to the zoo-keeper about moving the lion's pit to a place farther from the kids play area. She continues to give a lecture about increasing the lion's pit size before looking at her watch and realizing that she is late for work. Then we see a sign on the front of the Tender Loins advertising \"The Best Cervix in Town!\" The original footage picks up here. This whole sequence lasts for about 2 1/2 minutes. - 3. When Stripperella enters Flinderman's en route to FUGG headquarters, new footage has her stop to admire a shoe sale before her navel ring beeper beeps again, causing her to continue running to the secret door to the headquarters. - 4. After another model blimps up at the Stiffy Woods concert video, new footage shows a scene in the Tender Loins as Persephone is talking with her boyfriend. It starts when Persephone eats a Marcino cherry, revealing that she is able to do origami with her tongue when she works the stem and makes a miniature model of the Eiffel Tower. Her boyfriend is impressed, but the snotty Brit wannabe Siamese bother asks her if she learned that trick at \"whore school\". The date continues until the boyfriend chokes. Persephone performs the Heimlich maneuver, explaining that lots of strippers choke when they grab dollar bills with their teeth. The Brit wannabe remarks sarcastically about the anecdote, resulting in an argument. This lasts a little over a minute. - 5. The scene introducing Dr. Cesearean is extended when he makes the joke about seeing Enorma \"in the obituary column!\" The original scene ended when he went back into his office, whereas the new one continues with him laughing maniacally in his office as the the camera pulls out and reveals his waiting room filled with shocked onlookers. This ends with a \"To Be Continued\". - 6. The \"Next on Stripperella\" segment shows footage from Part Two, including a scene showing the Siamese twins fighting each other. - PART ONE runs for about 22 minutes without commercial."

This version of the shower scene was probably shot in case they decided to aim for a PG rating instead of an R. Also notable during this sequence, the on-screen credits are white (instead of red) and centered on the screen. Most profanity, especially during the scene with John Travolta and Nancy Allen arguing while he is driving, is re-looped to remove bad language.
