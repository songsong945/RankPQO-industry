        "A 113 minute 70mm workprint was shown at the some sneak previews in Dallas and Denver in 1982. The film scored extremely poorly from the test audiences, and it was this poor reaction which led to the happy ending and the voice-over narration. In 1989, sound preservationist 'Michael Arick' (qv) came across a 70mm print of Blade Runner in the TODD-AO vaults. Thinking it was the International Cut, Arick purchased the print for Warners, who loaned it out to the Los Angeles Cineplex-Odeon Fairfax Theatre in 1990 for a festival of 70mm prints. It was at this screening that people realized they were watching the Dallas/Denver Workprint. The film was subsequently screened at UCLA's Los Angeles Perspectives Multimedia Festival in 1991. A 35mm reduction of this version was later shown at the NuArt Theatre and the Art Deco Castro Theater in San Francisco in 1991. It was the success of these four screenings that prompted Warner Bros. to look into the possibility of releasing a Director's Cut of the film. The workprint briefly resurfaced again, by accident, for a one-week engagement (1/15 - 1/21) at the Seattle, WA Landmark Egyptian Theater in 1999. However, this print was the one-of-a-kind 70mm blow-up, directly from the Warner Bros. vault. In 2007, the workprint was made available to the public for the first time on disc 5 of the 5-disc Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD/HD-DVD/Blu-ray Disc of the film (which also contains the US theatrical cut, the European cut, the Director's Cut and the Final Cut). The differences between the workprint and the other versions include: - The logo for the Ladd Company is on a white background, not a black background. - The title screen for the film is different, with the words 'BLADE RUNNER' sliding onto the screen accompanied by the sound of knives. - New American Dictionary (2016) definition of a replicant is used in lieu of the opening credit crawl. - The opening shots do not include the close-up and subsequent pull-away from the eye seen in all other cuts, it simply cuts closer and closer to the Tyrell building. Additionally, the shot moving into towards the window is absent, as are two interior wide shots of Holden standing at the window. Throughout the scene, air-traffic control headings can be heard. - After Leon shoots Holden and he crashes through the wall, hitting the table, the shot stays on Holden as fan blades brush his hair and his back smokes from the gunfire. - Deckard's meal at \"The White Dragon\" can be seen being laid on the bar in front of him, rather than merely being heard. Additionally, the shot of Deckard rubbing his chopsticks together is longer. Also, as Gaff speaks to Deckard, the shot remains on Deckard rather than cutting to Gaff, showing Deckard having some difficulty eating his noodles. - As Deckard and Gaff are flying to the police station, in all versions of the film, you can see Gaff speaking to Deckard, but in the Workprint you can actually hear what he says. - During the briefing, the shot of Bryant getting a bottle and pouring two drinks is absent. Also missing is Bryant's line \"I need the old Blade Runner, I need your magic.\" - Bryant says \"two\" replicants were fried running through an electric field instead of one.\" - When looking at the incept tapes, Bryant comments on Leon's ability to work all day and night. - As Gaff and Deckard approach the Tyrell building, there is more air traffic control heard. - When Rachael asks Deckard if she can ask him a personal question, Deckard responds \"Sure. What is it?\" In all other versions of the film, he simply says \"Sure.\" - When Deckard and Gaff inspect Leon's address and the attendant opens the room for them, he mutters \"Kowalski\". - After Chew tells Roy that J.F. Sebastian will take him to Tyrell, the shot where Roy leans forward and says, \"Now, where will we find this J.F. Sebastian?\" is missing. - After Rachael has left Deckard's apartment, and he walks out onto the balcony, there is the sound of a police siren, which is absent in all other cuts. - When Deckard plays the piano in a depressed stupor: a) there is no unicorn vision, b) there is no background music, and c) we hear one or two notes Harrison Ford actually played on the set. - A whirring sound comes from the Esper that is absent in all other versions. - After zooming in on the shot of Roy in the photo, Deckard can be heard to say \"Hello Roy.\" Then, after printing the hardcopy, he says \"Zhora or Pris?\" - When Deckard gives the snake scale to the Cambodian lady, she says \"It will take a moment.\" - Deckard's search for Abdul Hassan lasts longer: we see more of Animoid Row and the back streets of the sector. As Deckard moves away from the Cambodian lady, there is an eighteen second crane shot showing Deckard disappearing into the crowd. - The dialogue heard during the scene with Hassan matches perfectly with the lip movements. - As Deckard nears Taffy Lewis' club, there is a twelve second crane shot showing the geography of the street. - There is a shot of two dancers in hockey masks outside Taffy's bar. - There is a shot of Deckard asking for directions to Taffy Lewis' from a uniformed policeman. - The audio-only introduction of 'Miss Salome' is slightly different. - There is a close-up shot of Deckard examining a sequin from Zhora's costume. - After Zhora attacks Deckard and flees, we see Deckard loosen his tie from his throat. - \"If I Didn't Care\" by the Ink Spots, is in the background when Deckard purchases a bottle of Tsing Tao, instead of \"One More Kiss, Dear.\" - After Rachael shoots Leon, the shot of him falling forward onto Deckard is absent, as is the shot of Rachael lowering the gun and stepping forward. - In Deckard's apartment, there is no \"Love Theme\"; the initial music track merely continues on longer. Also, Rachel plays a different selection on the piano when testing herself, and the shot of her undoing her hair and letting it floor to her shoulders is missing. - Roy says to Tyrell, \"I want more life, father\". - When Roy kills Tyrell, the footage is the same as in the International version, showing Roy's thumbs going into Tyrell's eyes and blood spurting out. Additionally, when Roy turns to Sebastian, he says \"I'm sorry, Sebastian. Come. Come\", as he walks towards him. As Sebastian turns to run, he can be heard whimpering. - Bryant's info to Deckard over the CB about Tyrell's and Sebastian's deaths are heard as we see Deckard driving through the tunnel. When Deckard is parked in his sedan on the street, he is merely preparing to call J.F.'s apartment before the police spinner interrogates him. Also, when the spinner arrives, we hear police sirens. - During the fight between, Pris and Deckard, we see Pris lift him up by the nostrils. - When Deckard shoots Pris, he shoots 3 times instead of 2. - There is the sound of a thunderclap as Roy examines Pris' body. - We actually see Roy break Deckard's fingers, in a split second close up, with a prop-hand. Also, the shot when Deckard pops his fingers back in is taken from a different angle, and Deckard's scream is much quieter than in all other versions of the film. - There are more shots of Roy running through the Bradbury. - When Roy pushes his head through the wall, there is an extra line; \"You're not in pain are you? Are you in pain?\" - There are more shots of Deckard as he climbs to the roof, and also more shots of him as he hangs on to the neighboring building. - The music during the chase is completely different from the music of Vangelis (according to 'Paul Sammon' (qv), the music used is from old soundtracks by 'James Horner' (qv) and 'Jerry Goldsmith' (qv)). - Different, farther-away shots of Roy as Deckard watches him die. Additionally, there is an alternate narration (the only narration in this version): \"I watched him die all night. It was a long, slow thing and he fought it all the way. He never whimpered and he never quit. He took all the time he had as though he loved life very much. Every second of it...even the pain. Then, he was dead.\" - Deckard's movement through his apartment as he searches for Rachael is different, with a wide shot of him scanning the room. The overall scene is approximately 20 seconds shorter than in all other versions - The shot of Deckard telling Rachael to wait before leaving the apartment is missing. - There is no happy ending, the film ends when the elevator doors slam. - There are no end credits, merely exit music for about a minute: the same cue heard as when Gaff takes Deckard to see Bryant at the start of the movie.",

There was also a \"Captain Future\" special named \"Star Trail To Glory\" (in French: \"La course \u00e0 travers le syst\u00e8me solaire\") consisting of two episodes (as a result, there are 54 episodes altogether), which is available in France on video and DVD as a movie. These two episodes have never been shown (or dubbed) in Germany.",

        "In December, 2003, the \"ALIEN QUADRILOGY\" box set was released with a newly created cut of \"Alien 3\" entitled 'the assembly cut.' It attempts to reconstruct David Fincher's workprint (which the studio balked at), but goes one step further and adds color correction, additional special effects and remixed 5.1 sound. Several scenes, however, suffer from poor on-set audio quality, mostly due to the use of fog machines and steam which obscures on-set dialog. Due to time and budget constraints, there was no time to re-record the dialogue for these scenes; optional subtitles transcript the dialog. It should be noted that the October 2010 \"ALIEN ANTHOLOGY\" Bluray boxset features the same 'assembly cut' as the 2003 DVD set. However, this time additional dialogue has been recorded, creating a soundtrack of more consistent quality, and making the addition of the deleted scenes all but seamless. Here are all of the found changes in the 'assembly cut': The scene of Ripley being rescued at the beginning is completely different. She is seen by Clements (Charles Dance) lying wahsed up on the beach and then taken into the prison, covered in dirt. A group of prisoners heads down to the beach with Oxen to get the EEV out of the water. In the theatrical print Ripley is discovered still inside her cryogenic unit inside the escape pod. This scene was re-shot to have footage of the dog (more on that later), and has no Oxen or scenes mentioned above. Various shots of people examining the escape pod that were in the theatrical print (as stated, they were taken from re-shoots made during post-production), including a shot of a facehugger crawling towards the dog and an elaborate optical shot of the EEV being carried out of the water by a crane (in the assembly cut it crashed right next to the shore), are missing from the DVD workprint. Immediately following the rescue sequence, 85 tells everyone in the mess hall to settle down, and Dillon preaches before Andrews' first 'rumor control.' The theatrical version started the scene directly with Andrews' rumor control. Just before the autopsy of Newt, there is a scene with Clemens, Ripley, and Prisoner Kevin walking down the spiral stairs into the morgue where Clemens questions Ripley about her need to certain Newt's death and also asks her if Newt was her daughter. Ripley denies this. As stated above, the alien comes out of an ox instead of a dog. There is a scene where two inmates are dragging an ox named babe after it has suddenly dropped dead into the butchery. They discuss what caused Babe's death, and they have some macho talk about Ripley. The scene ends when one of the inmates discovers a strange dead animal next to the ox's corpse (which is a dead Super facehugger). This scene replaces the scene in the theatrical cut where Murphy finds his wounded dog. The funeral scene is now intercut with scenes of the infant Alien bursting from the dead ox (originally it came out of the dog), concluding with a newly made digital shot of the Alien making its first steps and running off. Just before Ripley enters the mess Hall with her newly shaved head after the funeral, Prisoners Boggs and Rains share their complaints to Dillon about Prisoner Golic. They say he is crazy and smells bad, and that they don't want to work with him in the tunnels. Dillon tells them Golic is their brother and they should stop complaining. The scene in which Ripley and Dillon talk about temptations in the cafeteria ends on a shot of Dillon, where it originally ended on Ripley. Following Murphy's death, there is more dialog between Ripley and Clemens about why they had to cremate the bodies. Right after the scene where Ripley asks Clemens where the Bishop droid is, there is a scene where Dillon sees Boggs, Rains, and Golic, off on their excursion into the tunnels. Dillon asks them to light a candle for the dead prisoner Murphy (the first victim in the vent shaft). They go off into the tunnel. Immediately following this is the scene where Warden Andrews and Clemens meet to discuss Ripley. It has a completely new beginning, where the theatrical version begins with Andrews threatening Clemens, and ends with Andrews telling Clemens to \"sit the hell down.\" There is additional dialog here where Clemens explains to Andrews that Ripley was part of a combat team; Andrews eventually just tells Clemens to get out. Golic kicks open an old cigarette machine in the tunnel to get free cigarette packs. During Ripley's conversation with the reconnected Bishop, there are intercut scenes of a crazed and bloody Golic being found in the mess hall by Eric, the cook, who panics and drops the dishes. A little bit later, Golic is grabbed by the others (Clemens, 85, Andrews, and Dillon) and dragged to the infirmary. The scene following Andrews' talk with Ripley about the alien (where Ripley and Clemens talk) has a new opening shot in which the camera begins with a medium shot of Golic, then tracks through the hospital room. Later on in the scene, a tied up Golic interrupts with a few lines about how in an insane world, an sane man must appear to be insane; Clemens sarcastically thanks him. Golic spies on Ripley and Clemens talking by looking under the curtain. The alien drops from the air vent into the infirmary and lands on the mattress next to him causing it to 'lower'. There are more shots of it approaching, and Ripley sees it's feet through the bottom of the curtains. There is also a shot of the alien opening its mouth before killing Clemens. After the alien kills Clemens, and Ripley runs out of the infirmary, there is a close-up of Golic admiring the alien, he calls it \"magnificent.\" Followed by a shot of a large amount of blood dripping from the grate through which Clemens was hauled by the Alien (just after Ripley takes off for the dining hall). In the mess hall, Dillon leads a prayer and then chastises the prisoners for what has been going on (such as the attempted rape and the death of Murphy, Boggs, and Rains) as Ripley runs down the hallway. Andrews takes over with a sarcastic \"Thank you\" and the scene goes on as originally shown. A new shot where the prisoner mopping up Andrews' blood. He looks up at the air vent (an overhead shot). This is immediately followed by a new scene where Dillon preaches to the prisoners after Andrews' death. In the same scene after Morse says they should take Ripley's head and \"bash it through the fucking wall,\" Ripley replies \"That sounds good to me...\" There are several extra shots in the scene where the inmates set the trap in the tunnel (almost a minute's worth), including one with two inmates checking a pile of batteries, to see if there are some with enough electricity for Aaron's flashlight to work. Ripley looks exhausted while on paintbrush detail and shrugs it off, Dillon shows concern. As the explosions in the corridors are going off, there are several new shots of prisoners in the air vents engulfed in the flames and falling out of the vents on fire, as well as 85 running away from a burning prisoner. Dillon tries to activate the sprinkler to no effect (the sprinkler goes off in the theatrical version, and the scene ends right there). One of the prisoners is hurt badly and Ripley is trying to help him. The prisoner's friend Junior (the guy with the tear tattoo who initially attacks Ripley in the attempted rape scene) looks fearfully at her as she realizes both of them attacked her. The group runs for the spare sprinkler activator. The alien crawls down from the ceiling as the others (including Ripley and Dillon) try to lure it away. Junior is near the Toxic Waste room and sees a chance to trap the alien and runs into the room, causing the alien to run in after him and sacrificing his life. Ripley and Dillon lock the doors and the sounds of the alien killing him are heard outside. Dillon turns on the sprinklers. After finally putting out the fires, there are several new shots in the montage of prisoners walking through the wreckage of the hallways, and a scene where Dillon is leading a prayer for those who sacrificed themselves and died. Ripley and 85 look in from above and begin to discuss religion. 85 says that the company will arrive to kill the trapped alien with smart guns. Ripley asks him what to do if they won't kill it. Immediately following this, there is a scene where Morse is guarding the still bound Golic in the infirmary. Golic asks Morse to untie him, since his involvement in the killing of Boggs and Rains is no longer an issue. Morse reluctantly unties him, and after Golic asks him, tells him where the alien is trapped. Golic knocks him out and hurries out of the room. Next, there is a scene where 85 and Ripley are sending a transmission to the company about the trapped alien and Ripley, testing the company's intentions, requests permission to terminate the alien. The company quickly replies they are not to do anything against the alien, confirming Ripley's suspicions. Golic then arrives at the Toxic waste dump and tells the prisoner guarding the door he must talk to the creature. The prisoner shrugs him off and suddenly Golic slits his throat and opens the door, telling the alien he'll do anything he wants. Golic's screams as the alien attacks and runs away. Ripley then tells Dillon about the company's plans to keep the alien alive, which might jeopardize the entire universe. Dillon says he doesn't care about the rest of the universe. Ripley insists that innocent people will die and Dillon tells him that the world outside does not exist for them. Morse rushes in and tells them he has bad news. The three of them, along with 85 go to the dump where 85 blames Morse for the insane Golic's actions. Some of the latter scene was re-edited to make it follow the explosion sequence in the theatrical cut. A new scene in the assembly hall, after Ripley discovers she carries an Alien: the prisoners are arguing about the course of action to be taken; now that the Alien is free again, there is nothing stopping it from attacking them anywhere in the complex. One of the prisoners lights a match for his cigarette, which reminds all others of the Alien's fear of fire. They all decide to move to the furnace area immediately (which explains why Dillon's following 'peptalk' takes place there). When Ripley and 85 argue about contacting the company there is some extra dialog at the end of the scene. There is some added dialog in the scene where Ripley tells Dillon about the Queen inside of her, mainly about the nature of the Queen and the consequences of its survival. Also, when Ripley fights with Dillon after he refuses to kill her, there is an added line where Dillon says \"Go kill yourself\". During the scene where the remaining prisoners are meeting to discuss Dillon and Ripley's plan to terminate the alien, there are expanded dialog scenes concerning Dillon telling them they have a choice to get even with the creature for its destroying the others. Ripley then questions 85's statements that the rescue team is on its way. Some of the prisoners discuss religion before the tunnel sequence (right after Dillon says they are \"Praying\"). They laugh hysterically, which freaks out David (Pete Postlethwate). This replaces a scene where David is told by another prisoner named Jones what he's supposed to do. Jones leaves and David says to himself, \"This was her idea.\" Following this, there is a shot cut OUT of the assembly cut of 85 waiting for the rescue team. David (Pete Postlethwaite) finds Vincent's body in the tunnel. As the alien rampages through the tunnel, Ripley asks what the prisoners are doing (when two of them guarding the piston run off) and Dillon says \"Improvising\". There is more dialog when Bishop II confronts Ripley as he refers to the malignancy inside her and the great courage she has shown. There is also an added scene where the Asian medic explains the procedure to remove the alien from Ripley. When Bishop II asks Ripley to trust him and she must choose, the scene is more drawn out, and you can see Ripley agonizing more over the decision she must make. When 85 hits Bishop II with the pipe there is an additional moment which Bishop II can be seen in pain and wiping red blood from his face (adding more weight to the statement that he is indeed human and not an android. He shouts \"I'm not a droid!\" After this, Bishop sees one of his crew-members with a camera trying to film Ripley, and he tells the man with the camera, \"No pictures!\" Several shots of Ripley preparing for her jump, as she looks hesitant and nervous. She looks at Bishop and says \"You're crazy\" right before she jumps. Ripley's death scene is a completely alternate take: In the theatrical version, as Ripley falls, the alien queen burst out of her chest, here she simply falls into the lead. Her body can be seen burning up just before it hits the lead.",

        "A gorier, unrated version was released on DVD featuring scenes with violence more graphic than what was seen in the theatrical PG-13 version of the film. The differences are as follows (includes Spoilers): - In the PG-13 version, Shannon Elizabeth's character Becky is simply dragged away by the wolf at the end of the opening sequence. In the unrated version, Becky is torn in half and her bloodied upper-torso is tossed back at Jimmy and Ellie. - In the PG-13 version, during Ellie's nightmare, she merely bites Joshua Jackson's character Jake in the neck. The scene then cuts to a quick montage of bizarre images before Ellie wakes up. In the unrated version, after Ellie bites into Jake, she's shown ripping a large chunk of his neck off and then a torrent of blood shoots out of his wound. - In the PG-13 version, after Joanie knocks out Jake she starts looking for Ellie and Jimmy. In the unrated version, she first stops by Kyle's body, digs into the large gash in his stomach with her hands, pulls them out and then licks his blood off her fingers before proceeding to look for Ellie and Jimmy. - In the unrated version, Joanie (in wolf form) is killed when she is shot in the head and her brains slowly ooze onto the floor. - In the PG-13 version, the coroner discovers that Joanie's corpse has changed back into human form when her nude body is shown laying on the floor. In the unrated version, a sheet over her body is pulled back and only her face, complete with a bullet hole in her forehead, is shown. - In the PG-13 version, Jake's death by decapitation occurs off-camera. In the unrated version, Ellie is actually shown stabbing him in the neck with the shovel a couple of times before finally cutting his head off.",

The bootleg contains the following extra material not included in either the original theatrical release or the \"redux\" version. - A longer opening montage, the entire 10 minute song \"The End\" by The Doors is heard.It intercuts longer helicopters/jungle images with Willard in the hotel room in a drunken rage, as well as a scene where he is with a prostitute. There are various shots outside depicting the streets of Saigon. - When the two soldiers pick up Willard in the hotel room there is a brief conversation while they help him shower and shave. They notify him that his wait for his new mission is now over. - The scene where Willard is given his assignment is longer and contains much more dialogue. The general informs Willard that the mission is purely voluntary and he can decline it. The general also offers Willard a promotion to major upon completion of the mission. For some reason Colonel Kurtz is referred to in this scene as \"Colonel Leevy\". There are some external shots of the military base. - A brief scene where Willard is introduced to the crew of the Navy P.B.R. - Carmine Coppola's score is not present in this version. Many more songs by The Doors are played throughout the film instead. - None of the narration or dossier voiceovers are in this version. - There is no audio dubbing in this version. All the audio is from the sound recorded during the actual filming. Much of Robert Duvall's dialogue is unitelligable due to the sound of the helicopters in his scenes. - A much longer first cavalry \"Ride of Valkyrie\" attack scene (30+ mins)showing much unused footage and alternate takes. - A much longer playboy bunnies performance. - Various extended scenes on the boat, and alternate takes and shots. - A scene where a miniature toy boat passes the Navy PBR. Lance tries to grab it out of the water. The Chief yells at him to leave it alone claiming it's a booby trap. To prove it the Chief fires some shots at it to which it explodes. - When the P.B.R. reaches Do-lung bridge, the soldier that greets them gives a more detailed explanation of the chaos around the bridge. - When Lance is reading his letters on the boat, he suddenly stops to machine gun a water buffalo on the shore. The Chief yells at him to stop. - The sequence where Clean is killed is omitted. - A slightly longer French plantation sequence. After the French woman strips she crawls into the bed with Willard and they begin kissing. - The sequence where the Chief is killed is omitted. - More dialogue between Willard and the photojournalist when they first reach the Kurtz compound. The Journalist reveals that it was HE who was able to get the montangnards to break off their attack on the boat in the previous scene. Willard repeatedly asks the Journalists name but he refuses to answer. - The character of Colby, (the soldier who was sent before Willard to kill Kurtz, played by Scott Glenn) has a much more substantial role in this version. As Willard inspects the compound, Colby tells Willard that the night before, NVA soldiers had attacked (which explains all the bodies laying about the compound). Willard then enters Kurtz's house, much to the dismay of the journalist. Willard sees Kurtz empty bed and his medals, also his journal with the inscription \"Drop the bomb, exterminate them all\" (many of these scenes were in the final version but re-inserted in different places). - The scene where Willard talks to Chef about the air strike on the boat is omitted. - In this version. The first time Kurtz appears is the scene where a mud caked Willard is tied up (seated) to a pole in the rain. Kurtz appears with camouflage face paint, Willard asks....\"Why he is being mistreated?\" and tries to bluff his way past Kurtz by telling him that he had just completed a secret mission in Cambodia, and only stopped for supplies. Kurtz says nothing to him, but plants Chef's head in his lap. (Only a portion of this scene was in the original version). - The scene where Willard meets Kurtz in his bed chamber contains more dialogue....as Kurtz makes it clear that he knows why Willard is there. - A scene where Kurtz talks to Willard in the bamboo cage while two children sit on top of the cage and dangle insects in Willard's face. He tells him that Willard is \"like his colleagues in Washington, master liars who want to win the war but don't want to appear as immoral or unethical\". - A lengthy scene where the montangnards in a ritualistic display pick up the bamboo cage (with Willard inside) and poke him with sticks (Lance and Colby participate in this). The natives dance around the bamboo cage, chanting and singing while a squealing pig is tied up and killed. - A 10 minute version of the scene where Kurtz reads the poem \"The Hollow Men\", intercutting between his reading and the journalist talking with Willard. - A scene where the journalist meets Willard to tell him that he thinks Kurtz is about to kill him because he took his picture again. During which Colby comes behind the journalist and shoots him three times, killing him. Willard throws a knife at Colby's stomach to which he falls, but before he dies he asks Willard to talk to his family for him and asks him to kill Kurtz. - Kurtz speech about the horror and the children vaccination are omitted. - During the assassination scene at the end, before Willard enters Kurtz' home, one of the guards confronts him. Willard picks up a spear to defend himself as the guard picks up a child to shield himself. Willard runs the spear right through the child and into the guard. The final scene with Willard and the montangnards after Kurtz assasination are omitted.",

        "When Blind Fury was being prepared for TV in the early 90s, many changes were made to the finished film, adding short extensions here and there, as well as alternate \"TV friendly\" takes of various lines. Here's the full list of changes: 1. Alternate take: Billy sticks his tongue out at Nick to \"test\" his blindness, rather than giving him the finger as in the theatrical cut. 2. Deleted shot: Billy runs outside along his backyard pool, with a tracking shot revealing more of his dinosaur sculptures 3. Extended scene: Lynn mentions Frank not discussing the war, prior to Nick pouring the tea (thus, the \"he never even talked about the war\" line is removed later on). She later further expresses the difficulties of divorce. 4. Extended shot: After the cop at the bus station checks on Nick and Billy, the shot continues well after they leave, with the cop still staring. Due to a deleted scene later, the \"I get the window seat...\" line is removed. 5. Deleted scene: Nick goes to the cashier at the bus station to buy two tickets to Reno, only for the cashier (realizing Nick is blind) to try to trick him by giving him less change. Nick, aware of this, points out the mistake, and also knocks off the cashier's toupee onto a Slurpee. It's at the end of this scene where we actually see Billy say the \"I get the window seat...\" line. 6. Deleted scene: When Nick and Billy first begin their bus trip, it initially begins with Billy using his inhaler, later to use it to wake Nick up. Billy then continually complains that he can't sleep on the bus, with Nick bluntly replying with \"then don't\". This scene takes place prior to Annie visiting Frank, and temporarily replaces the scene with Billy flopping around and hitting Nick on the bus as he sleeps. This latter scene instead is placed after the Annie/Frank scene in the TV cut. 7. Deleted shot: Prior to the bus scene with Nick telling Billy about his father, there's an extra shot of the bus driving into Graceland, complete with a \"Home of Elvis Presley\" sign. 8. Deleted scene: In the middle of Nick's chase after Billy in the cornfield, he actually manages to stop him at one point, with Billy exclaiming the fact that his mother's dead and his father doesn't want him. 9. Extended scene: At the end of the scene with Nick and Billy by the campfire, when Billy attempts to \"see\" what Nick's life is like by closing his eyes, he hears footsteps, only to discover a nearby deer. Nick asks Billy to describe it, and he responds saying it's \"like a real deer... not like in a zoo.\" And that it also looks \"free.\" 10. Extended scene: When Nick and Billy are trapped in the back of Lyle and Tector's van, there's an additional segment in which Billy looks around saying \"It's so dark in here\". Nick, sarcastically, simply replies \"I thought it was just me.\" 11. Alternate take: After Lyle and Tector steal the car from the two old women and shoot out the back window, the TV cut uses a take of Lyle exclaiming \"What the?\" as opposed to the theatrical cut's \"Jesus H. Christ!\" 12. Deleted shot: After the alternate \"What the?\" take, the film cuts back to the two old women, with the unarmed woman saying to the armed one \"You always forget to reload!\" 13. Alternate take: When the driver that Nick nearly runs off the road realizes the Nick is blind, he exclaims \"Holy cow!\" rather than the theatrical cut's \"Holy shit!\" 14. Deleted shot: When Annie sees Nick off to find Frank, she tells him that she thinks Frank was set up by MacReady. 15. Extended scene: After Nick leaves Billy and Annie to find Frank, Annie asks Billy \"What did he say to you?\" Billy says \"To hold down the fort and protect the women.\" Annie responds with \"It's good to know we're in such capable hands Billy. In as deep a voice as he can muster, Billy says \"It's Bill.\" 16. Deleted scene: After Nick escapes from the casino riot to the elevator, there's an additional scene in which he starts eating the food off of the room service tray, as well as dropping his cigar into the coffee pot. 17. Alternate take: When Nick disables the elevator that Lyle and Tector are riding in, rather than the theatrical cut's \"Shit! Fuck! Shit fuck!\", the TV cut uses a far more tame \"Dog! Gone! Dog gone!\" 18. Alternate take: When Nick asks Cobb where Frank is, the theatrical cut has Cobb respond with \"F.O., Errol Flynn. Do you know what that means? Fuck off!\". However, the TV cut dubs in the line \"G.T.H., Errol Flynn.\" in the same two-shot used in the theatrical cut, but uses new footage on the close up on Cobb, with his alternate response of \"Do you know what that means? Go to Hell!\" 19. Deleted scene: After Nick knocks out Cobb and takes the key, the TV cut jumps to an extra short scene in which the Casino guards try to push Lyle into the elevator shaft, only for him to crash back down. Tector then asks \"You okay?\" 20. Extended scene: When Nick and Frank try to find Annie and Billy, there's a long take of Frank asking \"anybody home?\" before searching the inside of the modified bus. This cuts to a longer POV shot of Frank walking through the bus. 21. Deleted shot: After Frank makes the deal on the phone with MacReady, there's an additional shot of Frank exclaiming \"What I wouldn't give!\" and then calming down to say to Nick \"I guess you don't get any second chances, though, do you?\" 22. Alternate take: At the end of the Winterhaven ambush scene, an alternate angle/take of Nick stabbing Cobb is used, in which the bloodied blade and the final stab aren't as prominent as they are in the theatrical cut. 23. Deleted scene: Before Nick and Frank make their way to meet MacReady, Frank steps in saying \"Nick, this way!\" 24. Extended ending: As Billy tries to stop Nick from leaving, the overall scene is longer, with Nick saying that Billy is becoming a man and that he promises that he will call and see him again. This version rarely appears on TV anymore, but was more recently spotted on Reelz Channel.",

        "The home video release of this has a huge number of differences to the original TV version. Many of the scenes are shuffled in order and are much re-edited, and of most note is that much of the original dialogue is dubbed with especially recorded alternate versions, with much stronger swearing (including several instances of the \"f\" word) Some elements of the story (generally ones that would continue as threads in the TV series) are completely eliminated. Various differences include: - The opening credits captions are different, running slower. - A different version of the theme tune is played on the opening sequence. - Archangel discussing with the Senator the development of Airwolf (which gives much of the project's background) is much abridged. - Shots of Airwolf's on-board radar and maintanance screens are completely different. - Numerous scenes have different backing scores and sound effects. - A couple of close-ups of the photos in Hawke's cabin are of completely different photos to the original version. - For some reason, (most of) the story behind the paintings adorning the walls in Hawke's cabin is removed. - On the TV version, before Moffet and his crew head off to Libya in Airwolf, they destory a fighter jet over the desert. On the video version, there is a completely different version of the effectivley the same scene, with them destroying three figher jets over the ocean. - Asides from adding much stronger language, the video release also for some reason also changes numerous lines of dialogue. For pure example, when Hawke tells Dominic that he's got a tough mission for the pair of them, Dominic quips \"What're we gonna do, kidnap Kadaffi?\"; the TV version's \"Nothing that simple\" becomes \"No, a helicopter\". There's numerous other instances of lines of dialogue being changed. - The closing credits are (slightly) different. - The whole chunk of story of where Hawke and Dominic find a hiding place for Airwolf for after they retreive it (in a hollow mountain) and the whole last few minutes after Hawke's recovered & hidden Airwolf, and saying he'll only return it if the Firm find solid information on his missing brother, are completely gone. - The video version finishes (rather abruptly) with Hawke and Dominic having defeated Moffet, flying off over the ocean into the sun-set (in a piece of footage used on the TV episode 'Mad Over Miami') and the film finishing; as opposed to the TV version which has several more minutes with Hawke and Archangel discussing the return of Airwolf on condition that Hawke's brother is found, then Hawke going back out to the lake to play his cello. - Interestingly, there is a scene where twisted creator Dr. Moffet is torturing the kidnapped Gabrielle in the desert, that was in the original TV version but not on this release. This scene is quite strong and as a result is often edited out by many TV showings; considering the stronger nature of the video version, it's surprising it was not included. As this scene is not on the video release and is often cut out on TV, it could be considered to be quite rare",

        "A longer director's cut, titled \"Apocalypse Now Redux\", debuted on 11 May 2001 at the Cannes film festival. This cut was re-edited by Coppola and Walter Murch and features a new Technicolor dye prints with additional footage originally left out of thetheatrical release. The new version is 197 minutes long (53 minutes longer than the original version). The restored footage also includes the French plantation scenes with Aurore Clement and Christian Marquand, as well as scenes from the crew meeting the Playmates later on. - There are additional scenes when the crew is with Kilgore. During the napalm strike, he helps a wounded Vietnamese child. The napalm strike has ruined the favorable surfing conditions, so Lance and the others leave, much to Kilgore's dismay. Before they leave, Willard steals Kilgore's surfboard. Finally, just before Willard and Chef leave the boat to search for mangoes, a helicopter files by with Kilgore on loudspeaker, asking for his surfboard back. - In the Playmate scenes, Willard trades two drums of oil in exchange for spending two hours with the Bunnies. We see Chef with Miss May in a helicopter, and Lance with the Playmate of the Year in a ransacked house. Miss May was once a bird trainer at Busch Gardens and tries to talk about birds with Chef while he is busy trying to get her to re-enact her photo that he showed the crew. They end up kissing and Miss May gets excited because Chef kisses like a bird. The Playmate of the Year is talking to Lance about her troubles and insecurities about being a Playmate. Clean is seen trying to barge in on both men, and when he barges in on Lance, the Playmates open a chest (in which to hide) and discovers a dead Vietnamese. Lance comforts her. Chef finds out afterwards that Clean is a virgin and starts calling him names on the boat. Willard told Chief that the whole crew can spend time with the Bunnies, but Chief refuses. - At the plantation, Chef figures that they are French first and tells them in French that they are Americans and are friends. They bury Clean with his tape player there, and eat dinner with the French. The crew eats with the staff, and Willard eats with the family. Chef wants to speak to the chef but is informed he only speaks Vietnamese. Willard is lectured about France's colonial history in Indochine as well as their military blunders. There also is a scene with Willard and Roxanne, one of the French women, smoking opium. - At the Kurtz compound, Willard is imprisoned in an oven-like box. Kurtz appears, accompanied by a group of children. He reads to Willard from Time magazine articles about the Vietnam War.",

This shorter version makes the following changes: - An early scene in which Sada has sex with Ishida while playing a shamisen has been cut by about a minute and a half. In the original version, Sada seemingly goes unconscious and Ishida checks for her heartbeat. - A brief shot (12 seconds) of Ishida and Sada on a bridge has been added to the scene in which the couple goes out walking at night. - A later scene (in which the geishas assault one of their own with a dildo) is cut by 14 seconds to remove a shot of Ishida and Sada's faces in mid-copulation. - An entire two-minute scene is deleted about an hour into the film. This scene features Sada and Ishida having sex behind a thin screen, while Ishida speaks of the \"darkness\" he feels inside Sada. - The scene in which Sada first strangles Ishida is cut by just over one minute. In the short version, the scene ends when Ishida starts coughing and Sada releases his throat. In the original version, Ishida asks her to resume, which she does (only to stop when he begins coughing again). - The scene in which Ishida becomes drowsy while having sex with Sada is edited differently.

To fit the existing color footage to the uncut soundtrack, some shots are repeated. - Before Pike's line \"Don't help me. . . They can't read through hate\", the Keeper exits the menagerie. After that line, a shot from a later scene of the Keeper returning is re-used. This was made to cover up the dissolve to the later scene that was made for \"The Menagerie\" (1966). Originally, this shot followed a closeup to Veena, a cut to the Enterprise bridge, and a cut to the prisoners asleep in the cage. All of that was ruined (maybe permanently) by the dissolve made in 1966. - After Pike beams back to the ship, there is a reaction shot of Number One and Spock. The color print of this shot was lost, so what is used instead is a re-photographed shot of the shot played on the view screen (taken from \"The Menegerie, part II\").

Mai-Lee accidently hurts Kathryn while doing her toe nails and Kathryn yells at her in Vietnamese - a third scene is from the end of the movie, when Kathryn and Annette meet each other in the bathroom of Manchester. Only a minor change of dialogue takes place here though - finally and most interestingly there is the alternate ending scene. Sebastian still gets hit by a car, but not because of saving Annette. He just stops fighting when he sees her standing across the street and gets hit when he crosses it.

In this scene, he climbs up a frozen waterfall.  The scene which would have followed this was the one in the theatrical version where Stallone reaches the top of the mountain and runs to the lodge to meet Jessie.  According to Renny Harlin, the scene was cut because it didn't look real enough...the waterfall was a fiberglass wall and the background was optically inserted.  Also, they didn't want Stallone's character to appear invincible and be able to do anything, like in Rambo. - The second deleted scene is called \"King's Leap\" and occurs right after the scene where the bridge which connects the two mountain faces is destroyed. In this scene, Stallone does a running jump between the two mountain faces, and safely lands on the wall of the opposing cliff.  According to Renny Harlin, this was also cut because while climbers actually jump between mountain faces, the jump they had Stallone doing was a little to far to be believable.  They then got around the part of how Gabe & Jessie got around the mountain by having them backtrack and go all the way around.  Some audio was also re-recorded for that after the \"King's Leap\" was cut.. - Portions of both deleted scenes can be seen in the trailer for the movie",

Jeffrey also meets Sandy for the first time at the house. - An extended scene of Jeffrey with Dorothy in her apartment after Frank Booth leaves and finding another severed human ear in the bathroom sink. - An argument between Jeffrey and Sandy over his continued obsession in the Dorothy Valens case. - A rooftop scene during Jeffrey's second visit to Dorothy where she confides in him about her messed up life and wants to throw herself off the roof of the building. But Jeffrey stops her and they kiss for the first time. - A dinner scene where Jeffrey has dinner with Sandy and her parents where her boyfriend Mike joins them and grows suspicious at the table of the relationship between Sandy and Jeffrey. - A very surreal scene at the seedy nightclub \"This Is It\" where Frank and his three henchmen take Jeffrey and Dorothy through the dark, dimly lit place filled with topless waitresses, one of the lights her nipples on fire. Frank then beats up a man and throws him across a pool table for not fixing his jacket pockets for he \"lost his trophy.\" This explains how Jeffrey found the missing ear in the field behind the hospital, it apparently fell through a hole in Frank's jacket pocket. - A final epiloge scene at the police station where Jeffrey and Sandy give their statements to the press of the case and of Williams explaining that they found Dorothy's young son at the nightclub, Frank's henchmen are dead after the shootout at the warehouse, and the nightclub owner Ben and a few others have been aprehended at the club during the raid.",

The US DVD release was also heavily cut for an R rating with appreciably different cuts to the UK version which turns out to be the most complete. In the opening scene where Sweet (Matthias Hues) attacks a group of thugs the UK version is the most complete. In the UK version when Hues lifts up and head-butts a thug the camera pans down the thugs face revealing blood pouring from his mouth. In the US DVD the scene cuts away before the camera reaches his mouth. The DVD is also missing several punches to the next thugs ribs. The thug lying on the bed who gets his arm broken is cut identically in both versions. The scene where Dillon (Don Wilson) enters the dead prostitutes room is cut in the UK version. In the DVD we see a close up shot of the woman lying on the bed which is cut from the UK tape. The scene where the thugs attack Shanna's house is cut on the DVD. The knife wielding thug that attacks Dillon get his arm broken in the UK tape before he is thrown through the table. On the DVD the arm break is missing. The scene where Sweet attacks the two men on the street has been cut for the UK version. We should see Sweet lift up the first thug and head-butt him but this is missing from the UK tape (but surprisingly a photo of that exact scene is printed on the back of the tape). The scene where Sweet kills Dillons partner is cut on both versions. Close up punches to the face have been cut from the UK version. Sweet breaking the mans neck has been cut differently on both versions. In the UK version Sweet grabs the mans head and says 'Time to...' but the remaining dialogue (presumably 'Time to die') is missing and the man is lying on the floor with his neck broken. The DVD is also missing the neck break but all of the 'Time to die' dialogue is also missing. The final martial arts scene in Dillon's apartment has been cut differently in both versions. All scenes showing Nunchaku sticks have been cut from the UK version. Various snippets of martial arts have been cut from both versions. The scene showing Sweet impaled on a sword has been cut from the DVD.

        "Following attacks from politicians on violent films aimed at children, Warner Brothers. pushed the release date back and recut the film to a tamer version, toning down some of the violence in the original cut sent out in screener tapes. On April 23, 2001, the unedited version of the film was released in the US exclusively on DVD. Up until that point the uncut version had only been released as screeners that were sent out before the changes were made. The following are scenes that were changed in the edited-for-content version: - Lots of white flashes have been added to the action sequences where there were previously none. Additionally, combinations of punches have been mostly trimmed down to one punch. For example, Woof slashes the guard once now instead of twice. Batman no longer punches Ghoul in the gut, he just uppercuts him into the dish. Later on in the club, Terry's vicious attack on Ghoul is cut to a flash and Terry running away while Ghoul falls. There is a 360-degree fight sequence in the opening battle that has also been removed, where Batman fends off the Jokerz one by one. - Seat belts added to Terry and Bruce as the drive home after their first meeting with the new Joker. - Bonk is not shot, but given a lethal dose of laughing gas, and he dies off screen. Because of this the whole \"Take the trash outside, Dee Dee\" and \"Are you with me?\" sequence is cut. - When Bruce throws the batarang it appears as though he's pleased he can still throw & catch a batarang instead of it showing him using it to decapitate a Two Face dummy. - When Terry enters the Batcave to find it demolished by the Joker, the letter's 'HA! HA!' written across the floor are changed from red to purple. Probably to assure us it is not written on Bruce's blood. - All other blood is removed. (Only one example was passed over. In the flashback sequence when Batman smashes through the projection he smacks the Joker. Blots of blood fly from the Jokers mouth, but he is not bleeding in the next shot.) - In the unedited version, when Batman (in the present) frees himself from the Jokers' ribbon wrap, he throws the knife that he used to free himself with at the Joker. The Joker ducks at the last second and the blade goes through the stage curtain. This would explain the hole behind the Joker. - The Joker is not shot, but slips in some water and is electrocuted off screen. Plus, they don't mention they buried him deep under Arkham or any of that. The dialogue is completely changed in that sequence. - Barbara says that Leslie Thompkins helped Tim Drake \"regain himself\" instead of \"regain his sanity.\" (or something along those lines) - During a montage where Batman and Batgirl comb \"the underworld\" looking for clues about Robin's disappearance, Batgirl talks to a nicely-dressed man and woman instead of two sleazily-dressed women (who are pretty obviously hookers) on a street corner. - Also, Joker no longer slices Batman across the chest of in the leg, and any blood is digitally removed. Joker just punches Batman. - More than half of the \"Our Family Memories\" is cut out, only showing Robin tied up and struggling, and cutting the scene where Joker opens the barbeque lids, picks up the voltage tongs, and shocks the Boy. - A lot of dialogue is changed as well. And reference to the word \"kill\" is changed. - The opening fight seqeunce is trimmed, cutting out a second Dee-Dee kick and completely redoing that entire Batman/Dee Dee sequence. - The club fight is changed. The pink clown no longer punches Terry and says \"I don't know why the boss wants a dreg like you outta the way, but as long as it's fun...\". He just goes for his gun and says \"Slag him!\". - Bruce says \"Robin defeated him.\" instead of \"Robin did kill him\". Joker says \"Bat-Kook\" instead of \"Bat-Fart\". Jordan Price says \"Ice\" instead of \"kill\". Tim Drake says \"I can still hear his scream\" instead of \"I can still hear the shot\". Joker says \"...with such yutzes\" instead of \"...with such putzes\". - In the scene where the satellite laser chases the Batmoblie it blasts an unmarked, dark, seemingly empty building. Originally it was a lit movie theater. (In the edited version the word 'cineplex' can be seen exploding out of the wreckage in the last few frames of the shot.) - The clothing on 'Nanna Harley' is changed from blue and purple to Harley Quinn's trademark red and black.",

Oliver finds Irena there and they both agree to make love one last time (knowing that she'll become a panther again). The last scene in the movie has Oliver petting and feeding the Irena panther in a cage at the zoo. In the syndicated TV version it ends at the bridge when Oliver shoot's the Irena panther with a knock out dart and then cuts to the scene when he feeds and pets the Irena panther at the zoo. This eliminated the need to edit down the steamy last lovemaking scene.

After receiving that advice, the company chose to make cuts to the film for release in the UK and as a result the UK cinema version differs from the US cinema version. The changes occur in two scenes: - in the fight between Elektra and Bullseye the UK version lacks all sight of a dagger sticking through Elektra's hand and all sight of her removing the dagger from her hand. - Secondly, in the fight between Daredevil and Kingpin the UK version lacks a headbutt and has the sound of breaking bones partially obscured by a crack of thunder. For the home video release, 20th Century Fox submitted the uncut version and the BBFC passed it with no cuts. Therefore, home video/DVD releases in the UK are uncut.",

After its second post-premiere - the very next day - two scenes of 15 minutes total were deleted; making the film run its original world debut length at 181 minutes.

After its world premiere on September 29, 1954, 27 minutes was cut, bringing it down to a mediocre 154 time length. Those scenes were: 1) Esther quitting the band 2) The Trinidad Coconut Oil Shampoo 3) Esther working at a drive-in 4) Norman being driven away drunk in his car 5) Norman inquiring Esther's old landlady 6) Spotting Esther on the TV commercial 7) Tracking down Esther at her new boarding residence 8) Driving down the strip - Esther getting sick 9. \"Here's What I'm Here For\" musical number - Norman proposes 10. \"Lose That Long Face\" musical number - Vicki breaks down",
