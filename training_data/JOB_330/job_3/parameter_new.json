In the original Thorn EMI release she remains fully clothed throughout and when Fallon is asked if he wants to 'check out this piece of merchandise' him and Sally simply walk off screen. In the 2005 DVD Sally undresses in front of the gang at Patsy's insistence and is naked when Fallon approaches her. Another scene that was a different take is when Norris kills Fallon in the woodwork lab. In the Thorn EMI release he simply pushes Fallon back over the saw blade killing him almost instantly. In the 2005 DVD he cuts off Fallon's right arm first, Fallon then staggers upright and THEN Norris pushes him back on the blade. Other scenes cut completely and now reinstated are: - The entire fight with Joo Joo's gang. - The rape scene - Barnyard, Patsy and Drugstore finding Fallon's body - Drugstore's death scene (more close ups of his body) - Norris hitting Barnyard more times on the head with the pipe. - Stegman cutting Diane's breasts before fighting Norris. Also the 2005 DVD has written prologue and epilogue. The prologue states the amount of attacks on staff in US High Schools and states that 'no high school is as bad as Lincoln High....yet'.

It then adds new footage of Batman and Catwoman fighting. It then cuts to Barbara Gordon's apartment, intercut with footage of her fighting. It cuts directly from her in the shower to her opening the door, where she is shot by Joker. The whole thing has new narration by Alfred Pennyworth. - The most obvious difference is that Harley Quinn was recast. Scenes originally shot with 'Sherilyn Fenn' (qv) were reshot with 'Mia Sara' (qv). - There a few alternate scenes involving Barbara Gordon, including one that indicates her involvement with a fellow teacher has been going on for six months.

        "Several scenes (most of which can be read in the film's script) were shot but removed or altered for various reasons, either for content or to keep the running time under two hours. These scenes are, in chronological order: - The earliest versions had Clyde shooting and killing the butcher during their fight. This was toned down to Clyde just shooting the butcher, and finally just pistol whipping him. In real life, speculation still exists as to whether 'Clyde Barrow' (qv) actually committed the crime this is based on; although his photo was picked out, the method in which it was executed doesn't fit his MO. In the final cut, there is a brief jump in the film during the fight, where it was spliced from the original, more graphic conclusion. - After picking up C.W., Clyde and Bonnie take him to a diner where they plan their next robbery. - After Clyde kills Doyle Johnson (the man on the running board), Bonnie talks with CW in the bathroom while Clyde cleans his guns and laments his actions. In the bathroom CW bathes and Bonnie attempts to seduce him, but changes her mind when CW proves to be less than romantic material. A still from this scene-- Bonnie wearing a slip and Clyde's hat-- can be seen on the DVD. - A longer scene of Buck and Blanche's approach to the motor lodge. Buck is singing Bible hymns and Blanche scolds him for bringing her to see Clyde. - A longer version of Bonnie's visit home; she sits in the car and her sister gives her a perm (a portion of this-- Bonnie on the running board getting her hair put up-- exists in the final film). - A very long sequence in which Bonnie and Clyde get drunk and come to terms with their impending death. They trash their room and rip out the mattress from their bed, turning it into a makeshift coffin. They then put on their best clothes and put makeup on each other so they can see what they will look like when they're dead. The scene concludes with Bonnie and Clyde dancing around CW by candlelight and chanting \"The Hearse Song.\" - During the Platte City raid, C.W. uses a machine gun to attack the armored car instead of grenades. - The final shootout, in it's earliest form, was done entirely with still photos shown over sounds of machine gun fire and screams, and we never actually saw Bonnie or Clyde dead. The movie ended with the two farmers running towards the car while \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\" Played in the background.",

Esteban's run in the city to the tavern is shorter, but an additional overhead shot is shown. The scene in which Pedro and Sancho are telling the story about the city of gold is shortened (they don't talk about how the patrons of the bar should invest in their adventure.) There is an additional scene of Esteban looking shocked when the official says \"find him and you'll receive a whole piece of gold.\" There is a scene difference in when Mendoza is waiting for Esteban at the dock, he waits longer, but Esteban's run to meet him is shorter. The ending of Episode 1 is omitted in that Esteban discovers Zia only. The scene in which Mendoza smiles at the discovery that Esteban makes of Zia, and the both looking to see the clouds turn into the winged serpent forshadowing things to come is not there. - Episode 2: The daydreaming scene in which the golden butterflies turns into the city of gold is omitted, as well as the daydreaming scene in which Esteban is seasick and floating above the mayan ruins. - Episode 3: The daydreaming scene of the seamonster eating the ship is omitted. - Episode 4: Has the longest runtime of all the episodes of the series contains many additions, cuts, and an alternate ending. Additions include Extended footage of Mendoza rescuing the children with Esteban grabbing onto him through the bars so he doesn't get sucked out, followed by Dialogue of Gomez on the deck of the ship saying something about Gaspard. Gomez then slides down the deck of the ship and gets into the boat. There is a scene added in which Pedro and Sancho wake up in each others arms on the deck of the Esperanza when Esteban calls to Mendoza about the St. Elmos fire. There is also an extended scene after the shark attack where Pedro and Sancho say something off camera, and goes into an on camera dialogue with Esteban and Zia's dialogue about Esteban's father. - Omitted scene: There is a small scene of the raft sitting still in the sunlight. - Alternate Ending: Once the Island is discovered our heroes merely paddle their way toward the island, seeing shots of the lizards, and shots of the island. The Episode ends right here, and the entire footage in the English/French versions of Mendoza swimming from the sharks is gone. - Some of the scenes from Episode 4 alternate ending and the rescue can be seen in the English/French version Previous and To Follow segments - Episode 5: This starts where the English/French Episode 4 ends at the raft on the island. There is a scene omission of Zia lifting her dress to sit down. This Episode ends right where Tao points the crossbow at Esteban. - Episode 6: Starts in the tree house right where Episode 5 left off, and has a small scene of Mendoza Pedro and Sancho arriving on the raft. From this point forward all Episodes are in Synch with the English/French versions, with very few differences. - Episode 9: Starts with an additional second of footage zoomed in on the Solaris's sail - Episode 27: Has a second of footage containing a lightning bolt omitted at the start of the Episode - Episode 29: In the Japanese version when Esteban Tao and Zia are struck by the Olmec ray, Esteban spins around much slower and the background isn't changed as much. - Closing Credits: There is an additional bit of animation used of the sun and then transitioning to Esteban's face - None of the previous, to follows, or live action documentaries are on the Japanese DVD's",

After that a scene has been added where Salieri and Mozart visits Cavalieri in her lodge. Caterina throws some surly remarks about Constanze before she too comes and asks that she and Mozart go home. Mozart walks out on Caterina, and the scene goes to Salieri saying that he knew Mozart \"had had her\". - When Salieri asks \"What was God up to?\", the monologue has been extended, with Salieri speculating that it might be a test by God. - After Salieri admits to have started to hate Mozart, a shot has been inserted of Salieri praying, asking that Mozart be sent to Salzburg. This is immediately followed by the shot of the archbishop telling Leopold that he won't take Mozart back. - After Mozart refuses to submit his work for the royal appointment, a scene has been added showing Wolfgang and Constanze arguing. This establishes that the couple is in need of money. - When Constanze goes to visit Salieri in secret, the scene has been extended, starting with Salieri teaching a student. - The biggest addition comes after Constanze asks if Salieri will help them; instead of just walking out on her, he says says that she must come to his place, alone in the evening, strongly implying they must have sex for him to recommend Mozart's on the committee. - The scene switches to Salieri praying at his clavichord as Constanze arrives. She begins to undress, with Salieri looking shocked. When she is half-nude, Salieri calls in his valet and tells him to escort Constanze out. Humiliated and furious she throws a candelabra after him. Wolfgang finds Constanze crying in bed at home. This explains why Constanze is so eager to throw Salieri out of her home at the end of the movie. - Another large section is added where Salieri implies to the emperor that Mozart has been molesting young female students. This results in someone else getting the royal appointment. Mozart comes to see Salieri, receiving the news. Mozart asks Salieri for a loan, again establishing that he needs money. Salieri recommends Mozart give lessons to a Herr Schlumberg's daughter. The lesson however turns out a major frustration for Mozart, with Herr Schlumberg's dogs howling and causing a ruckus. - A scene has been added where Salieri and Baron Van Swieten discuss Mozart's financial difficulties. This is followed by a shot of a drunken Mozart again visiting Herr Schlumberg, asking if he may give lessons and - when denied - asks for a loan. That request is denied as well.",

        "The R2 Special Edition (available on the Alien Quadrology Boxset as well as separately) contains 7 extra minutes of altered and/or extended scenes. As a result, there is a little more character development, but the music has also been re-edited (a bit poorly) in some scenes. Here follows a short description: - The main titles (the distorted shots of the 7 early Ripley clones in the theatrical cut) have been replaced by an alternate opening, which starts with a close-up of a growling alien mouth. As the camera pulls back, it is revealed to be the beak of a fly, that is subsequently squashed by a thumb of a soldier. The soldier uses a straw to blow the fly's blood against a window, which shows that he is actually sitting in a nacell of the Auriga spaceship. The rest of the shot shows the Auriga slowly flying away from camera. - Directly after the chestburster has been surgically removed from Ripley 8, she wakes up from her narcosis, grips the surgeon's arm and breaks it. - In the scene where Ripley is shown drawings of a glove and fruit, directly after Genral Perez, Wren and Gediman leave, the doctor shows Ripley a drawing of a young, blond girl, which seems to trigger an emotional memory in her. - During the meal scene, Ripley repeats Gediman's 'Fiori 16', and he asks her what she remembers. Dr. Wren can also tells some more about the Weyland-Yutani company (\"bought up by Wall-Mart\") - The 'Betty introduction scene has been completely re-edited and extended. The scene now starts with the Betty flying towards the Auriga, Elgyn giving the clearance code over the radio (E-A-T-M-E), but now he flirts some more with Hillard, and warns Call and Vriess over the intercom to get ready. Next, Call and Vriess are shown working on the cargo, followed by some extended dialogue in which Vriess tells Call an obscene joke. This is followed by the scene in which Christie gets his hidden weapons (which came first in the original cut). Next is Johner's 'target practice', Vriess then throws a tool to his head, Call calls him names, but Johner simply replies by asking for his knife. When Vriess comments on his alcoholism, Johner demans his knife back, Call breaks it, Johner threatens her, and there is an extra line from Vriess that he and Cal deserve better company. - During the deal between Elgyn and Perez, Elgyn has some more 'flattering' remarks about Call, thinking Vriess has an eye on her. After Elgyn asks Perez for three days bed and board, Perez agrees under a few conditions (no tresspassing in restricted areas, no trouble, no fighting). - After Purvis shouts \"What's in-f###ing-side me?!?\", Wren answers: \"A parasite! A foreign element!\" After Call says that Purvis can be frozen and operated later, she has another run-in with Johner, followed by Christie agreeing that Purvis comes, but saying he will shoot him if he starts acting funny. - Just before everyone takes a dive through the flooded kitchen, Christie and DiStephano have a short conversation on Christie's weapons ('the disposable kind'), and Call reminds everyone to take a deep breath. - In the chapel, just after Purvis' fake chestburst, there is an extended line from Call, stating she recalibrated ground level, sending the ship into an uninhabited quadrant of Earth, before she mentions time of impact. After Ripley asks if she's the new a##hole model, she replies she couldn't let humanity annihilate itself. Ripley comments that she once tried to save people as well; she remembers a girl that had bad dreams, but she died despite her help, and now she can't even remember her name. After DiStephano enters to take them with him, Ripley asks Call if she dreams, which Call does thanks to neural processors; Ripley says she dreams about the aliens every night, and that she used to be afraid, but not anymore, since it is always worse when she wakes up. - After Johner kissed Vriess for getting them safely through Earth's atmosphere, there is an alternate ending with the Betty landing on Earth. Call warns Ripley for the military that will come looking for her soon. She says someone can get pretty lost on Earth, and asks Ripley what to do. Ripley replies that she doesn't know, since she is a stranger there herself. The camera then goes up, to reveal a post-apocalyptical Paris.",

Taking a cue from classic movie epics, the opening reels now set up the basic themes with greater economy: Alexander's Oedipal relationship with his parents, Olympias' ambitions for her son, the boy's need to surpass his father, and the entirely natural way in which myth/religion is shown as integral to the ancients' behavior. Oliver Stone reworked the third act, juxtaposing events in India and Greece. And Jolie's Olympias emerged more as a genuinely pathetic figure in the whole tragedy. Stone wanting to isolate her character's own ambition from the one person she loves. Ptolemy's final scene was edited.

The Ferrari in the end of the movie has been dubbed by Michael Schumacher as in the original version (but of course in Italian, with some German accent). 'Giancarlo Fisichella' (qv) makes a cameo. A nice coincidence: 'Marco Della Noce' (qv), who dubs Luigi, is an Italian comedian whose trademark act (several years before the release of _Cars (2006)_ (qv)) was playing of the head mechanic of Ferrari, and includes some of the lines from this routine in the dubbing.",

It was at this screening that people realized they were watching the Dallas/Denver Workprint. The film was subsequently screened at UCLA's Los Angeles Perspectives Multimedia Festival in 1991. A 35mm reduction of this version was later shown at the NuArt Theatre and the Art Deco Castro Theater in San Francisco in 1991. It was the success of these four screenings that prompted Warner Bros. to look into the possibility of releasing a Director's Cut of the film. The workprint briefly resurfaced again, by accident, for a one-week engagement (1/15 - 1/21) at the Seattle, WA Landmark Egyptian Theater in 1999. However, this print was the one-of-a-kind 70mm blow-up, directly from the Warner Bros. vault. In 2007, the workprint was made available to the public for the first time on disc 5 of the 5-disc Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD/HD-DVD/Blu-ray Disc of the film (which also contains the US theatrical cut, the European cut, the Director's Cut and the Final Cut). The differences between the workprint and the other versions include: - The logo for the Ladd Company is on a white background, not a black background. - The title screen for the film is different, with the words 'BLADE RUNNER' sliding onto the screen accompanied by the sound of knives. - New American Dictionary (2016) definition of a replicant is used in lieu of the opening credit crawl. - The opening shots do not include the close-up and subsequent pull-away from the eye seen in all other cuts, it simply cuts closer and closer to the Tyrell building. Additionally, the shot moving into towards the window is absent, as are two interior wide shots of Holden standing at the window. Throughout the scene, air-traffic control headings can be heard. - After Leon shoots Holden and he crashes through the wall, hitting the table, the shot stays on Holden as fan blades brush his hair and his back smokes from the gunfire. - Deckard's meal at \"The White Dragon\" can be seen being laid on the bar in front of him, rather than merely being heard. Additionally, the shot of Deckard rubbing his chopsticks together is longer. Also, as Gaff speaks to Deckard, the shot remains on Deckard rather than cutting to Gaff, showing Deckard having some difficulty eating his noodles. - As Deckard and Gaff are flying to the police station, in all versions of the film, you can see Gaff speaking to Deckard, but in the Workprint you can actually hear what he says. - During the briefing, the shot of Bryant getting a bottle and pouring two drinks is absent. Also missing is Bryant's line \"I need the old Blade Runner, I need your magic.\" - Bryant says \"two\" replicants were fried running through an electric field instead of one.\" - When looking at the incept tapes, Bryant comments on Leon's ability to work all day and night. - As Gaff and Deckard approach the Tyrell building, there is more air traffic control heard. - When Rachael asks Deckard if she can ask him a personal question, Deckard responds \"Sure. What is it?\" In all other versions of the film, he simply says \"Sure.\" - When Deckard and Gaff inspect Leon's address and the attendant opens the room for them, he mutters \"Kowalski\". - After Chew tells Roy that J.F. Sebastian will take him to Tyrell, the shot where Roy leans forward and says, \"Now, where will we find this J.F. Sebastian?\" is missing. - After Rachael has left Deckard's apartment, and he walks out onto the balcony, there is the sound of a police siren, which is absent in all other cuts. - When Deckard plays the piano in a depressed stupor: a) there is no unicorn vision, b) there is no background music, and c) we hear one or two notes Harrison Ford actually played on the set. - A whirring sound comes from the Esper that is absent in all other versions. - After zooming in on the shot of Roy in the photo, Deckard can be heard to say \"Hello Roy.\" Then, after printing the hardcopy, he says \"Zhora or Pris?\" - When Deckard gives the snake scale to the Cambodian lady, she says \"It will take a moment.\" - Deckard's search for Abdul Hassan lasts longer: we see more of Animoid Row and the back streets of the sector. As Deckard moves away from the Cambodian lady, there is an eighteen second crane shot showing Deckard disappearing into the crowd. - The dialogue heard during the scene with Hassan matches perfectly with the lip movements. - As Deckard nears Taffy Lewis' club, there is a twelve second crane shot showing the geography of the street. - There is a shot of two dancers in hockey masks outside Taffy's bar. - There is a shot of Deckard asking for directions to Taffy Lewis' from a uniformed policeman. - The audio-only introduction of 'Miss Salome' is slightly different. - There is a close-up shot of Deckard examining a sequin from Zhora's costume. - After Zhora attacks Deckard and flees, we see Deckard loosen his tie from his throat. - \"If I Didn't Care\" by the Ink Spots, is in the background when Deckard purchases a bottle of Tsing Tao, instead of \"One More Kiss, Dear.\" - After Rachael shoots Leon, the shot of him falling forward onto Deckard is absent, as is the shot of Rachael lowering the gun and stepping forward. - In Deckard's apartment, there is no \"Love Theme\"; the initial music track merely continues on longer. Also, Rachel plays a different selection on the piano when testing herself, and the shot of her undoing her hair and letting it floor to her shoulders is missing. - Roy says to Tyrell, \"I want more life, father\". - When Roy kills Tyrell, the footage is the same as in the International version, showing Roy's thumbs going into Tyrell's eyes and blood spurting out. Additionally, when Roy turns to Sebastian, he says \"I'm sorry, Sebastian. Come. Come\", as he walks towards him. As Sebastian turns to run, he can be heard whimpering. - Bryant's info to Deckard over the CB about Tyrell's and Sebastian's deaths are heard as we see Deckard driving through the tunnel. When Deckard is parked in his sedan on the street, he is merely preparing to call J.F.'s apartment before the police spinner interrogates him. Also, when the spinner arrives, we hear police sirens. - During the fight between, Pris and Deckard, we see Pris lift him up by the nostrils. - When Deckard shoots Pris, he shoots 3 times instead of 2. - There is the sound of a thunderclap as Roy examines Pris' body. - We actually see Roy break Deckard's fingers, in a split second close up, with a prop-hand. Also, the shot when Deckard pops his fingers back in is taken from a different angle, and Deckard's scream is much quieter than in all other versions of the film. - There are more shots of Roy running through the Bradbury. - When Roy pushes his head through the wall, there is an extra line; \"You're not in pain are you? Are you in pain?\" - There are more shots of Deckard as he climbs to the roof, and also more shots of him as he hangs on to the neighboring building. - The music during the chase is completely different from the music of Vangelis (according to 'Paul Sammon' (qv), the music used is from old soundtracks by 'James Horner' (qv) and 'Jerry Goldsmith' (qv)). - Different, farther-away shots of Roy as Deckard watches him die. Additionally, there is an alternate narration (the only narration in this version): \"I watched him die all night. It was a long, slow thing and he fought it all the way. He never whimpered and he never quit. He took all the time he had as though he loved life very much. Every second of it...even the pain. Then, he was dead.\" - Deckard's movement through his apartment as he searches for Rachael is different, with a wide shot of him scanning the room. The overall scene is approximately 20 seconds shorter than in all other versions - The shot of Deckard telling Rachael to wait before leaving the apartment is missing. - There is no happy ending, the film ends when the elevator doors slam. - There are no end credits, merely exit music for about a minute: the same cue heard as when Gaff takes Deckard to see Bryant at the start of the movie.",

        "The unrated directors cut runs 112m 37s. The R-rated U.S. theatrical version runs 100m 13s, with numerous MPAA-imposed cuts for sexual content/dialogue and a couple New World Pictures-imposed ones for unknown reasons. - 16s of candid opening dialogue are trimmed in the R-rated version. After one of the group members tells Donny Hopper (Bruce Davison), \"Fuck you, Hopper,\" the following lines present in the unrated version are all removed -- Donny: \"I do. Every night. Me and my jar of Vaseline. I can fuck any woman I want and I don't even have to make her come.\" Female group member: \"Really? Well, I'd rather get fucked by a vibrator than your cock any day. It's honest, loving, and I don't have to make breakfast for it in the morning.\" The dirty Adam and Eve joke in Donny's monologue that survives in the R-rated version is pushed up further than it appears in the unrated version, while the main titles are slowed down. - In the scene where China Blue (Kathleen Turner) explains to Carl (John G. Scanlon) how she plays the flute and then gives him a blow job, the R-rated version shows it in one long take using alternate footage, with the camera never losing sight of his face as she goes down on him. The unrated version cuts away from him to show two close-up shots of her face next to his crotch, unzipping his bulging jeans and caressing the fly with her hand. These are bookended by an insert shot of an erotic, B&W line drawing, showing in triplicate, a Japanese woman giving a blow job to a Japanese man (who possesses one gargantuan erect penis and testicles). The unrated version of the scene runs 14s longer, because Turner says her lines more slowly. - The beginning of the China Blue/Carl aftermath scene uses alternate take footage in the R-rated version, up through the shot of China making a gargle and answering \"Miss Liberty.\" Carl's orgasm is over as he says \"fucking incredible\" once -- while in the unrated version, he's still having one as he says it twice -- and when he asks China her name, the camera again focuses on him in one long take. In the unrated version, shots of Carl alternate with four shots of China Blue bent down (with very smudged lipstick, as she wipes her mouth) and one shot of her hand turning off the radio. The R-rated version of this runs 14s longer again, mostly because both actors say their lines more slowly. - The scene where China Blue's second trick (Pat McNamara) rapes her has been truncated in the R-rated version. It cuts to Reverend Shayne standing outside after one sexual thrust, while the unrated cuts to it after sixteen more thrusts (intercut with five different erotic, color drawings of Japanese men and women engaged in you-know-what) and is 16s longer. - An additional 2 thrusts, totalling 2s, have been trimmed from the overhead shot of China Blue's second trick finishing the deed in the R-rated version. The unrated version has music over it, while U.S. theatrical prints have none. - In the unrated version, China Blue calls trick #2 \"sweetdick,\" a phrase which he then repeats. The R-rated version overdubs both utterances of the word with \"sweetheart.\" - When Reverend Shayne first gets in to see China Blue and tells her he's there to save her, she replies, \"Why don't you fuck me, that'll save me\" in the unrated version. The R-rated version overdubs the word \"fuck\" with \"fix.\" - China Blue goes on to tell Reverend Shayne that she's \"Fit as a fiddle and ready for cock\" in the unrated version. The R-rated version overdubs the word \"cock\" with \"love.\" - The R-rated version of the scene where Bobby Grady (John Laughlin) breaks into China Blue's apartment loses 21s of him turning on a wall-mounted TV and her VCR, which plays a porno tape of a man and woman having anal sex. - 50s are cut from the R-rated version after Bobby unzips the red panties in China Blue's drawer. The unrated version goes on to show him pulling out a book and opening it up to reveal the same kind of erotic Japanese drawings that were seen during China Blue's rape. Bobby turns the pages, stands up, and confusingly looks back and forth at the TV -- which now shows the man having a threesome with two women and cultimating in one of them -- and the book, before he has a revelation. Later in the film, when Bobby pays his first visit to Joanna's (Kathleen Turner) apartment, he comments on a similar, albeit somewhat less graphic, piece of artwork hanging on her wall, saying that he \"saw these a book once.\" This is left in the R-rated cut, so viewers who've only seen that version won't know where it was he saw it and what book he's talking about. - The R-rated version of the shot where China Blue undresses Bobby as they're about to first have sex has 7s trimmed of her unzipping his jeans and starting to remove them. - 1m 32s have been deleted from China Blue's and Bobby's first sex scene in the R-rated version -- 15s of them continuing to make out, the remaining 1m 17s of them doing the nasty in silhouette as he demonstrates all the new positions he just learned about in her book. - A 2m 37s scene of Bobby and Amy (Annie Potts) having a fight in front of Jimmy and Lisa (Seth Wagerman, Christina Lange) during breakfast was removed from the U.S. theatrical version by New World Pictures, possibly because Amy is extremely unpleasant in it. Bobby gets annoyed at her for pouring maple syrup, which he doesn't like, on his pancakes, she gets annoyed at him for noticing a week after the fact that she got her hair done, and she needles him by insinuating to the kids that he's stupid and useless because he can't plant a garden and doesn't know what strontium 90 means. He finally has enough of her cutting him down, and leaves for work in a huff. This scene appears in the film after the one where Reverend Shayne knocks Bobby down and Bobby and China Blue make amends. - New World Pictures broke the Grady family barbecue into two scenes in the U.S. theatrical cut. In that version, they bookend the scenes of China Blue being picked up by Arthur and Claudia (John Rose, Louise Sorel) in a limo and Reverend Shayne stabbing the blow-up doll. In the directors cut, the barbecue appears in its entirety immediately after that scene. - The unrated version contains a 3m 38s sequence of China Blue putting on her wig and makeup, picking up a handsome, corrupt cop (Randall Brady) on the streets, taking him back to her place, handcuffing him to her bed while wearing a leather S&M getup, having rough sex with him -- which causes his wrists to get cut up by the cuffs and his legs to get cut up by her high heels -- and grinding his nightstick into his stomach before sodomizing him with it, as Reverend Shayne watches the entire thing from behind his peephole, stroking his missile vibrator up and down. All of this is intercut with one erotic B&W Japanese line drawing -- similar to the one shown during Carl's blow job -- and three blood red-tinted photographs showing policemen in the line of duty. Afterwards, Reverend Shayne lies down and goes to sleep, and she uncuffs the cop and asks if he'd like to take a shower there, as she's got Ivory soap which is 99 44/100% pure (repeating what Bobby said after their first time), but he just spits on her in disgust, and she washes her face off in the sink (echoing what Bobby did after their first time), crying, after he's left. The MPAA refused to give the film an \"R\" unless this entire scene was removed. However, the shot which follows this -- of China Blue putting on her makeup in the mirror, still crying -- remains in the R-rated version, making it unclear exactly what she's upset about. - New World Pictures removed 2m 17s from the scene where Amy goes down to Grady's electronics store to try to rekindle with Bobby, again presumably because Amy is extremely unsympathetic. The theatrical cut of it ends when she tells him, \"All I want is my husband.\" The director's cut continues with her saying that the kids need a father to teach them responsibility, and him telling her he doubts it'll do them any good with the two of them playing a charade in front of them. He lets her know he doesn't want to get back together, and she correctly figures out that he's met someone else, as she can \"smell her all over\" him. She then returns to her old ways, and starts nagging him about the other woman. After he admits in stride that he's having an affair, she warns him to remember his family and make a choice.",

This version is available as a bootleg. A full list of scenes cut are: - The scene where they are in the shop in the beginning is removed from the \"uncut\" version and is replaced with an extended scene of them driving the truck through the woods. Then they stop when Burt says he left something back at the store and they have a longer conversation about the map. - The scene of Rider Strong going behind the building to wash his hands after Dennis's bite and he pets the stray dogs is removed from the \"uncut\" version. - A different angle of Jordan Ladd's character Karen swimming away after the \"kiss\" scene on the dock with Rider Strong. - When it is discovered that Karen has the disease during an intimate scene, there is an additional scene that follows the \"Don't...Leave...Me!\" where Burt comes into the room and yells at her about how the truck isn't ready yet, and they have to finish cleaning up the bum's blood. - An extended scene of everyone arguing around the fireplace when Burt makes a joke about his burnt marshmallow. - A scene of Burt sitting outside guarding the shed with his shot gun. This immediatly follows when they hear the dog trying to get Karen in the shed and they shoot a bullet and tell Karen that they will stay outside with her to keep the dog away. - The gunshot to Burt's head in the cabin is bloodier. In the \"R\" rated version it cuts away quick and only shows the aftermath from a difficult-to-see angle. - An additional scene where Rider Strong grabs the long-haired hick after the attack and drags him down to the celler. He yells at the hick as he throws him down there and says \"When they get here, tell them I didn't do it!\", then slams the door. - The human-bonfire scene when they say \"We got another one in the basement\" immediatly goes to a shot of the celler door opening from the inside, then a bunch of shotguns appear and start shooting like crazy. We see blood all over the walls. Then they pour gasoline and one cop lights a match and celler goes up in flames followed by more shots of blood and guts on the walls, ceiling, and floor. - The end is switched around a little. Instead of just the cops drinking the contaminated lemonade followed by a country song with the townspeople, the whole entie town shows up and has a cup. There is additional dialoug amoung the townspeople, different shots, and it shows the FDA man walking around more testing and the Water supply truck is in view longer. - That is every scene that is changed or cut from the Lions Gate release.",

        "The Anchor Bay special edition DVD, released in 2002, contains six deleted scenes (a couple of which also appear on the LD), cut by Ken Russell for pacing, time and conventionality reasons, and some brief additional dialogue during the China Blue/Adrian car ride. The six scenes, which have optional commentary by Barry Sandler noting why they were removed, are: - An additional barbecue scene with Bobby and Donny reminiscing about screwing the loosest girl in high school (whom everyone was lining up to screw). Bobby confesses that he never went through with it, because he had just started seeing Amy. Amy and Sheila (Yvonne McCord) then have a discussion in the garage about unhappy marriages and unexciting lives. Sheila admits that the happiest time of her life was when she left Donny, Amy tells her that Bobby tries so hard to make things work, and Sheila advises her to dump him and stop wasting his time. This was bracketed in the film by the limo scene with China Blue, Arthur and Claudia. (5m 11s) - Joanna and Bobby lie in bed post-coitus. She has her doubts about letting her cover down, a fight erupts, and he storms out of her apartment to go stay at Donny's. (2m 3s) - Joanna knocks on Bobby's door, as she now needs him. She wants to try again, and he's happy to comply. Appeared in the film after Joanna leaves Ben's (Gerald S. O'Loughlin) and Adrian's (Peggy Feury) house. (1m 4s) - Joanna sits in her car, parked outside the Grady family home, so she can see how his other side lives. Amy drives home with Jimmy, tells him to go wait inside, chides Joanna (aware that she's the other woman) for daring to come to her house, and both women spill their guts. Appeared in the film in between the scenes of Joanna slamming the door in Bobby's face after their reconciliation and Amy giving Bobby his old football jersey. (2m 53s) - Bobby enters Jimmy's bedroom and helps him with a diorama of the solar system. He tells his son that he's not staying, and Jimmy begs him to, because he promised he would be. Appeared in the film after the scene where Amy gives Bobby his old football jersey. (1m 20s) - Bobby shares a drink in a bar with a very drunk Donny. He tells Donny about Joanna and that he just said goodbye to Amy and the kids, before he heads off to see Joanna. Donny then tries and fails to pick up a woman, who's revolted by him. Appeared in the film in the middle of Reverend Shayne's attack on Joanna. (2m 53s) Some versions, such as the Anchor Bay DVD, have the \"It's a Lovely Life\" video out of sync with the music, and the camera's-eye views of Bobby filming China Blue and Reverend Shayne in B&W (which is how they are in the longform music video), instead of blue-tint. For some odd reason, the DVD removes the New World Pictures copyright ((c)Copyright 1984 New World Pictures All Rights Reserved.) in the end credits, replacing it with a cheap video insert ((c)1984 New World Pictures. All Rights Reserved.) after all the credits have rolled.",

Wat and Roland say there should be three phoenixes, since there's three of them. - Lord Adhemar's original introduction scene, where he slaps around one of his servants while having his armor fitted, and reference is made to the \"triple phoenix\" design of Sir Ulrich's crest. - Chaucer giving another substantial introduction for Sir Ulrich, similar to the first one, right before his match with Lord Adhemar. He berates Adhemar's herald before the speech; after the speech, Adhemar's herald appears impressed, which leads to his imitation of Chaucer's style later in the film. - When Adhemar leaves the dance, we find out the reason for his pained expression; in a deleted scene, he reveals to a monk that he is tone-deaf, and has never been able to hear music as anything more than noise. Adhemar then strides out into the midst of the poor, waiting outside the castle for handouts, and starts a riot by throwing food and money into the crowd. - Another deleted scene has Will, Roland, Wat, and Kate seeing Chaucer walking back to their quarters naked again. They follow him, but it turns that he was fetching food for his wife, Phillipa (who is also naked), and had not lost his clothes gambling like they thought. They leave, laughing, and run into Jocelyn and Christiana. Christiana and Roland leave together (with a suggestion of romance), William and Jocelyn leave together, but when Wat holds out his hand for Kate, she just hands him a pastry and walks off. Wat says \"Hey, Beautiful\" to the pastry and walks off happy anyway. - The original version of the scene with William in the stocks is considerably longer, and has an extensive speech by Chaucer (which is probably his best in the film). Rather than having the crowd calmed by the appearance of Prince Edward, the crowd is converted by Chaucer's speech, and has already begun chanting \"William, William!\" by the time the Prince reveals himself. A much stronger version of the scene, but cut down in favor of having the Prince's role expanded.",

        "Differences between the East Coast and West Coast versions: - 1. East Coast: When Jack tells Liz to have a good show, Alec Baldwin drops his magic book in the middle of his line. West Coast: This time, Baldwin doesn't pick up anything until he gets the line out first. - 2. East Coast: In a flashback, Julia Louis-Dreyfus references _Slumdog Millionaire (2008)_ (qv) by calling to Jonathan with, \"Yeah, Chai Boy, get in here. You'll never be a millionaire.\" West Coast: Instead, Louis-Dreyfus references _Aladdin (1992)_ (qv) by saying, \"Hurry up, Aladdin, before Jasmine is forced to marry Jafar!\" - 3. East Coast: Jane Krakowski sings the 30 Rock opening, which has lyrics questioning the wisdom of throwing a live show. West Coast: Cheyenne Jackson sings the 30 Rock opening, incorporating region-specific lines like \"Let's talk about sushi\" and \"Portland, Vegas, Glendale, this is 30 Rock!\" - 4. East Coast: There's a bad boom mic shadow at the end of the Rachel Dratch elevator scene. West Coast: Fixed! - 5. East Coast: Liz tells Tracy, \"Audiences love it when something goes wrong,\" and the Who Dat Ninja poster swings lazily in the background a beat too late. West Coast: The poster cue gets nailed. - 6. East Coast: As Liz leaves his dressing room, Tracy tells his entourage, \"Gentlemen, tonight I'm gonna laugh harder than I did at Dotcom's play.\" West Coast: Tracy Morgan totally butchers the line, realizes it, and starts grinning. - 7. East Coast: Jenna tells Pete about her song, \"It's Your Birthday, Slut.\" West Coast: Jane Krakowski forgets the \"slut\" part of her line briefly, but recovers. - 8. East Coast: According to online surveys, Jack \"has a drinking problem.\" West Coast: According to online surveys, Jack \"is a problem drinker.\" The difference is small but profound. - 9. East Coast: During TGS's Fox News sketch, the chyron for President Obama reads, \"Exclusive Interview with Kenyan Liar.\" West Coast: This time, it reads \"Impartial Interview with Barack Obammunist.\" - 10. East Coast: In his commercial, Dr. Spaceman's first song includes the line, \"Light some candles, draw a bath, and start off with full-on intercourse.\" West Coast: It's been revised to \"Light some candles, draw a bath, and tie me to my radiator and put food just out of reach.\" - 11. East Coast: Spaceman's second song goes, \"Baby, let's let the dog watch us. Do you think he understands the love that we have? Oops, I'm finished, call yourself a cab.\" West Coast: Now it's \"Girl, I've been knowing you a long time, and I think tonight's the night / This time, you can be the man.\" - 12. East Coast: Matt Damon's first appearance in the show gets wild cheers at the beginning and end of his scene. West Coast: Complete silence from the audience. - 13. East Coast: A paint-sniffing Jack tells Liz, \"Men need alcohol. It's the first thing every civilization makes, along with weapons and shelters to enjoy prostitutes.\" West Coast: This time, Jack says, \"Men need alcohol. It gives us the ability to hit on women, and later, when we're married, to tune them out.\" - 14. East Coast: Flashback Jack Donaghy makes out with one of his three dancing ladies. West Coast: Flashback Jack is much more chaste, though still barechested. - 15. East Coast: Jon Hamm appears as his hook-handed character Drew Baird, narrating a commercial like so: \"Thanks to an idea that started as a pitch for a horror movie and then grew into a charitable organization, hands from executed criminals are now making life better for people all over the world.\" West Coast: It's been changed to: \"Thanks to groundbreaking research at the Yale University for hand frankensteining, hand transplants are a reality.\" - 16. East Coast: Drew shows off his transplanted hand, which is a little bit scary-looking and tries to choke him. West Coast: Now, Drew's new hand is from a lady: \"Donors are rare. As you can see, I've had to accept a female hand.\" The hand strokes his face and then goes towards his crotch. \"Oh God,\" he moans. \"Please take off your rings!\" - 17. East Coast: In the final scene, Liz is happy with how her birthday went. After all, she even \"got to eat the cake off the floor.\" West Coast: This time, she \"ate the Fonz's face.\" Still off the floor, presumably.",

Instead, the last we see of him is when he's lying on his back in the burning room and we hear the words of his daughter \"everybody dies\". The camera zooms in on the numbers on the outside door, just as they melt from the heat. The next scene is at Mike's funeral where his coffin is lowered into the ground right next to his daughter's; just as the visions 1408 prophesied. Lily is there, being consoled by Mike's agent. As the procession ends, Lily walks to her car and is met by Gerald Olin who is carrying a box. Gerald introduces himself and gives his condolences. He says the box contains some of Mike's belongings still left in the room. He offers it to Lily while also trying to explain, with a sense of hope, that Mike's death of was not in vain and that because of his actions no one else will *ever be able to stay in room 1408. Lily, in too much grief to listen, cuts him off and refuses to accept the box. Gerald returns to his car and opens the box, which contains the nightgown that was sent through the fax machine as well and the burned tape recorder. Gerald plays it and hears the same dialog between Mike and his daughter heard at the end of the theatrical release. As he listens, he sees a young girl in his rear-view mirror waving in his direction. He turns around to look at her and catches a brief vision of Mike Enslin in his back seat, hideously burned. Gerald jumps but the vision quickly disappears. He looks back at the girl who has found her dad that was looking for her. Gerald catches his breath, starting his car and driving off. The final scene goes back to room 1408. We see a specter Mike Enslin staring out the window. The last shot is of him finishing his cigarette and walking towards the door just as he vanishes.",

The reason for this is because Sailors Mars, Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury die in the Japanese version, and it is clear they are dead. In the DIC version, they make it seem that they have only disappeared (e.g., when Mars is in that little ice hut on the ground, they cut it off).",

        "When Blind Fury was being prepared for TV in the early 90s, many changes were made to the finished film, adding short extensions here and there, as well as alternate \"TV friendly\" takes of various lines. Here's the full list of changes: 1. Alternate take: Billy sticks his tongue out at Nick to \"test\" his blindness, rather than giving him the finger as in the theatrical cut. 2. Deleted shot: Billy runs outside along his backyard pool, with a tracking shot revealing more of his dinosaur sculptures 3. Extended scene: Lynn mentions Frank not discussing the war, prior to Nick pouring the tea (thus, the \"he never even talked about the war\" line is removed later on). She later further expresses the difficulties of divorce. 4. Extended shot: After the cop at the bus station checks on Nick and Billy, the shot continues well after they leave, with the cop still staring. Due to a deleted scene later, the \"I get the window seat...\" line is removed. 5. Deleted scene: Nick goes to the cashier at the bus station to buy two tickets to Reno, only for the cashier (realizing Nick is blind) to try to trick him by giving him less change. Nick, aware of this, points out the mistake, and also knocks off the cashier's toupee onto a Slurpee. It's at the end of this scene where we actually see Billy say the \"I get the window seat...\" line. 6. Deleted scene: When Nick and Billy first begin their bus trip, it initially begins with Billy using his inhaler, later to use it to wake Nick up. Billy then continually complains that he can't sleep on the bus, with Nick bluntly replying with \"then don't\". This scene takes place prior to Annie visiting Frank, and temporarily replaces the scene with Billy flopping around and hitting Nick on the bus as he sleeps. This latter scene instead is placed after the Annie/Frank scene in the TV cut. 7. Deleted shot: Prior to the bus scene with Nick telling Billy about his father, there's an extra shot of the bus driving into Graceland, complete with a \"Home of Elvis Presley\" sign. 8. Deleted scene: In the middle of Nick's chase after Billy in the cornfield, he actually manages to stop him at one point, with Billy exclaiming the fact that his mother's dead and his father doesn't want him. 9. Extended scene: At the end of the scene with Nick and Billy by the campfire, when Billy attempts to \"see\" what Nick's life is like by closing his eyes, he hears footsteps, only to discover a nearby deer. Nick asks Billy to describe it, and he responds saying it's \"like a real deer... not like in a zoo.\" And that it also looks \"free.\" 10. Extended scene: When Nick and Billy are trapped in the back of Lyle and Tector's van, there's an additional segment in which Billy looks around saying \"It's so dark in here\". Nick, sarcastically, simply replies \"I thought it was just me.\" 11. Alternate take: After Lyle and Tector steal the car from the two old women and shoot out the back window, the TV cut uses a take of Lyle exclaiming \"What the?\" as opposed to the theatrical cut's \"Jesus H. Christ!\" 12. Deleted shot: After the alternate \"What the?\" take, the film cuts back to the two old women, with the unarmed woman saying to the armed one \"You always forget to reload!\" 13. Alternate take: When the driver that Nick nearly runs off the road realizes the Nick is blind, he exclaims \"Holy cow!\" rather than the theatrical cut's \"Holy shit!\" 14. Deleted shot: When Annie sees Nick off to find Frank, she tells him that she thinks Frank was set up by MacReady. 15. Extended scene: After Nick leaves Billy and Annie to find Frank, Annie asks Billy \"What did he say to you?\" Billy says \"To hold down the fort and protect the women.\" Annie responds with \"It's good to know we're in such capable hands Billy. In as deep a voice as he can muster, Billy says \"It's Bill.\" 16. Deleted scene: After Nick escapes from the casino riot to the elevator, there's an additional scene in which he starts eating the food off of the room service tray, as well as dropping his cigar into the coffee pot. 17. Alternate take: When Nick disables the elevator that Lyle and Tector are riding in, rather than the theatrical cut's \"Shit! Fuck! Shit fuck!\", the TV cut uses a far more tame \"Dog! Gone! Dog gone!\" 18. Alternate take: When Nick asks Cobb where Frank is, the theatrical cut has Cobb respond with \"F.O., Errol Flynn. Do you know what that means? Fuck off!\". However, the TV cut dubs in the line \"G.T.H., Errol Flynn.\" in the same two-shot used in the theatrical cut, but uses new footage on the close up on Cobb, with his alternate response of \"Do you know what that means? Go to Hell!\" 19. Deleted scene: After Nick knocks out Cobb and takes the key, the TV cut jumps to an extra short scene in which the Casino guards try to push Lyle into the elevator shaft, only for him to crash back down. Tector then asks \"You okay?\" 20. Extended scene: When Nick and Frank try to find Annie and Billy, there's a long take of Frank asking \"anybody home?\" before searching the inside of the modified bus. This cuts to a longer POV shot of Frank walking through the bus. 21. Deleted shot: After Frank makes the deal on the phone with MacReady, there's an additional shot of Frank exclaiming \"What I wouldn't give!\" and then calming down to say to Nick \"I guess you don't get any second chances, though, do you?\" 22. Alternate take: At the end of the Winterhaven ambush scene, an alternate angle/take of Nick stabbing Cobb is used, in which the bloodied blade and the final stab aren't as prominent as they are in the theatrical cut. 23. Deleted scene: Before Nick and Frank make their way to meet MacReady, Frank steps in saying \"Nick, this way!\" 24. Extended ending: As Billy tries to stop Nick from leaving, the overall scene is longer, with Nick saying that Billy is becoming a man and that he promises that he will call and see him again. This version rarely appears on TV anymore, but was more recently spotted on Reelz Channel.",
