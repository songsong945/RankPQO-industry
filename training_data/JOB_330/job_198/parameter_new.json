Instead, the last we see of him is when he's lying on his back in the burning room and we hear the words of his daughter \"everybody dies\". The camera zooms in on the numbers on the outside door, just as they melt from the heat. The next scene is at Mike's funeral where his coffin is lowered into the ground right next to his daughter's; just as the visions 1408 prophesied. Lily is there, being consoled by Mike's agent. As the procession ends, Lily walks to her car and is met by Gerald Olin who is carrying a box. Gerald introduces himself and gives his condolences. He says the box contains some of Mike's belongings still left in the room. He offers it to Lily while also trying to explain, with a sense of hope, that Mike's death of was not in vain and that because of his actions no one else will *ever be able to stay in room 1408. Lily, in too much grief to listen, cuts him off and refuses to accept the box. Gerald returns to his car and opens the box, which contains the nightgown that was sent through the fax machine as well and the burned tape recorder. Gerald plays it and hears the same dialog between Mike and his daughter heard at the end of the theatrical release. As he listens, he sees a young girl in his rear-view mirror waving in his direction. He turns around to look at her and catches a brief vision of Mike Enslin in his back seat, hideously burned. Gerald jumps but the vision quickly disappears. He looks back at the girl who has found her dad that was looking for her. Gerald catches his breath, starting his car and driving off. The final scene goes back to room 1408. We see a specter Mike Enslin staring out the window. The last shot is of him finishing his cigarette and walking towards the door just as he vanishes.",

This changes the feel of the entire scene--as though they were suggesting that Soundwave is attempting to discover the secrets of transforming (while he himself is transformed, mind you). - They dubbed in a new swoosh sound as Soundwave lunges for Spike. - In the scene change from Soundwave retreating to Prime spotting him, the animation takes on a strange greenish hue while it's inside the computer window.  I think the computer animators forgot to adjust their tint settings; once the window goes away, the colors of the scene are restored. - When Prime is dangling on the ledge inside the power plant and Megatron asks if he has any last words, when Prime says, \"None you'd wanna hear, Megatron!\" they used an inset of Prime's head.  The problem is, they took it from a later scene when he's back outside, so it's got a blue sky background. - They also added a fizzling sound when Megatron steps on Prime's hand. - The \"green screen\" effect happens again when Prime grabs Jazz's grappling cord. At the end, during the preview for part 3, they sampled the sound effect of Hound creating the holographic rocket base and reused it for the scene of Prime being blasted out of the sky by the Decepticon space cruiser. - The voice credits are from \"More Than Meets the Eye\" this time, but there is no mention of 'Welker, Frank' (qv).",

The girls start to wonder if Raye is dumping them and getting a new best friend. In Japanese, Minako suggests that Rei may be on a date with the girl! Usagi can't believe it but Minako points that it could be just like Haruka and Michiru. Then Mako (Lita) wonders if the girl might really be a man dressed as a woman! Raye agrees to help Maya with her problem, but in Japanese it's actually the reverse - Maya agrees to help Raye by performing at the festival. Later, Raye talks about how she is helping Maya overcome her nerves. In Japanese, Rei talks about how hard Maya works and begins to feel some despair about how hard one needs to work to be successful. In the end, she and Serena agree to just do their best. This episode introduces a new voice for Rini (now played by Stephanie Beard).  Sailor Mini Moon is called Sailor Chibi Moon in Japanese (chibi=small, mini).",

This alternate version also have slightly different end credits, and does not mention Harold marrying Sybil. The differences are minor (the U.S. version provides a more shocking memento of WWI, when it shows crippled baggage handlers in the station); one of the reasons the cricket scene was dropped in favour  of the station one was due to the distributor's worry that the American  market would not understand it.",

The missing scenes are: - All of the scenes involving a character called the Crying Drunk Girl (Jennifer Elise Cox) who is so drunk that she has subtitles for when she speaks and she is the key to what is going on in movie. Her missing scenes of dialogue are: - After Preston and Denise talk with the Yearbook Girl, the Crying Drunk Girl walks up to them and says, \"Thush bezt weveram sisu gizem chext ear.\" (subtitle translation: \"This is the best party ever! I'm gonna miss you guys next year!) She group hugs them and walks away where Preston says, \"There's one at every party.\" - After Preston walks away from the Exchange Student at the backyard pool, the Crying Drunk Girl walks over to the Exchange Student and says to him, \"Idlik tach yre enis!\" (I'd like to touch your penis!) - When Kenny and Denise suddenly get locked in the upstairs bathroom and scream \"NOOOOO!!!\" the tracking shot from the bathroom door leads down the steps directly to the Crying Drunk Girl who somehow hears them and she says \"Yerd dum shelling yers chairs.\" (Did anyone hear that? Somebody's yelling for help upstairs!) But since no one can understand her, no help comes to Kenny or Denise. - When Amanda is talking to the Stoned Guy and the Watermelon Guy about who Preston is, the Crying Drunk Girl stumbles over to Amanda, leans on her shoulder, and says: \"Snow stun shy is shy sumber shess sing.\" (I know who Preston Meyers is. I can give you his phone number, his address, anything.) Unable to understand her, Amanda just shrugs her off and walks away. - During the police raid, one of the cops is talking to the Crying Drunk Girl on the front lawn of the house who asks her to stop crying and speak clearly and she says, \"I allred tdya, mnwans is mray hunds, ive at seveithg nolfok. (But I already told you! My name is Mary Hampson and I live and 1781 Norfolk!) Unable to understand her, the cop puts in her in a police van with Kenny's two Homboys and others who include the Hippy Girl, the Headbanger and others. - Also deleted was the scene involving the Stoned Girl (Amber Benson) who is glimpsed holding a banana as William walks through the kitchen to taste his first beer. It takes place in between the scenes where Kenny hits on Ashley and Jana where he sees her leaning against a dining room shelf and talks to her, but all she says is \"Okay\" everything he says. Then another girl walks in and thanks Kenny for finding her and says that Stephanie (the name of the Stoned Girl) just took three thingies of herbal ecstasy is so out of it. The girlfriend helps the Stoned Girl to her feet and they leave, leaving Kenny alone and downbeat. - Also deleted was the original opening which takes place in a bookstore the day before the graduation where Preston is talking to Denise about his desire for Amanda and his plans for going away to college. - When Kenny and his two homeboys first arrive at the party, Kenny plays around with a large sheepdog, named Mr. Tuxford, at the front door who belongs to the Girl Whose Party It Is, who jumps onto Kenny licking his face where he pushes the dog away who runs out the front door and the Girl runs after him. - There is more dialogue after when Kenny and Denise are released from the upstairs bathroom where the Girl Whose Party It Is continues yelling at Kenny and about the destruction they brought to her house as they are walking down the stairs where the house is now completely deserted and ransacked, and then the Girl's dog runs into the house and she drops to one knee and hugs the dog while Kenny takes this distraction to walk out and follow Denise. - A scene where the Watermelon Guy holds up a large watermelon and says \"This was in my freezer since September and I've poured six bottles of vodka into it and I've been saving it for this time!\" When all the guys around him grab at it, the watermelon falls on the kitchen floor splattering. - A scene in the \"make-out room\" where Mike Dexter enters looking for Amanda in the basement lit with dim red light and he turns on the basement lights revealing a dozen or more scantly clad boys and girls necking and shirtless William is among them with one of the Groupies and another girl. William gets up, puts on a blue band shirt, turns the lights back off and follows Mike upstairs after saying he remembers what he was supposed to do tonight. - During the raid when the Yearbook Girl tries getting her yearbook floating on the swimming pool after William throws it in, she falls head first into the pool. She climbs out and runs into a group of kids running from the cops and falls back in the pool again. Then the Reminiscing Guy appears, pulls her out with of the pool as her savior with her yearbook and they make their getaway. - More scenes with William and the Stoned Guy who put marijuana in the mini dinosaur and inhales from the mouth and then gives it to William for a try. - As Preston is walking away from the trash cans after throwing away his letter to Amanda, he passes by a car where a girl's leg is sticking out of a window and the unmistakable sounds of lovemaking are heard from the car. - An extended scene with Kenny and his two Homeboys in the convenience store where they are talking while they are bringing their stuff to the cash register to purchase. - In the scene where the Hippy Girl is tasting a marijuana brownie with the Hippy Guy, she tells him that he's supposed to melt the weed in with the butter, not put it in the mix and then says: \"these brownies suck!\" and then throws it in the direction of Denise. - The final scene at the diner is expanded with a shot from the Yearbook Girl and the Reminiscing Guy looking at some romance between them, the shot moves to the next booths where they show the band of the bass player, drummer, guitarist and lead singer trying to make sense about the night before, to the Foreign Exchange Student and the Crying Drunk Girl having found each other and both talking in incoherent, nonsense language and understanding each other, to at least two other booths, including the Girl Whose Party it was, before stopping at the booth with Mike Dexter and his jock friends. - The final parts of 'where the characters are now' were changed. The original Kenny and Denise part originally read: Denise dumped Kenny later that day. Denise went to NYU, where she found a whole bunch of people just like her. Bored at it all, she dropped out and started shooting photo covers for Rolling Stone Magazine. She currently directed the latest music video for Wu-Tang Clan. - The original Kenny bit read: Kenny went to UCLA and found a bunch of people just like him. Unable to compete, he reinvented himself as an eco-conscious vegan nudist. He currently lives with a cult in Northern California. - Other character bios read: William's friends, Geoff Piccirilli and Murphy Pelan, did not go to college. They created a comic book called Citizen X about a man with no identity, no Social Security number, nothing, who uses his anonymity to infiltrate numerous conspiracies involving the government, aliens, and the abduction and subsequent probing of them and other innocent people by extraterrestrials. They are currently dating no one. - Another character quote reads: Amanda's cousin, Ron, is currently in prison. - The Girl Whose Party It Is was also featured and it reads: The Girl Whose Party It Was, Molly Stinson, dropped out of college her freshman year to work as an intern for her role model, Martha Stewart. Three months later, she was hospitalized for a nervous breakdown. She is currently working as a librarian. - The Crying Drunk Girl's character read: The Crying Drunk Girl, Mary Hampson, attended college for nearly two years, then dropped out to become a tour guide at the White House, a job she still holds. Her favorite times at work is leading groups of school children in an enthusiastic rendition of the Pledge of Allegiance.",

In it Miklo and Popeye strike a deal: Miklo will erase Popeye's debt to La Onda in return Popeye will cast a vote for him in the council. - There is an added scene where Popeye stabs Smokey during a phony deal.

        "Several scenes (most of which can be read in the film's script) were shot but removed or altered for various reasons, either for content or to keep the running time under two hours. These scenes are, in chronological order: - The earliest versions had Clyde shooting and killing the butcher during their fight. This was toned down to Clyde just shooting the butcher, and finally just pistol whipping him. In real life, speculation still exists as to whether 'Clyde Barrow' (qv) actually committed the crime this is based on; although his photo was picked out, the method in which it was executed doesn't fit his MO. In the final cut, there is a brief jump in the film during the fight, where it was spliced from the original, more graphic conclusion. - After picking up C.W., Clyde and Bonnie take him to a diner where they plan their next robbery. - After Clyde kills Doyle Johnson (the man on the running board), Bonnie talks with CW in the bathroom while Clyde cleans his guns and laments his actions. In the bathroom CW bathes and Bonnie attempts to seduce him, but changes her mind when CW proves to be less than romantic material. A still from this scene-- Bonnie wearing a slip and Clyde's hat-- can be seen on the DVD. - A longer scene of Buck and Blanche's approach to the motor lodge. Buck is singing Bible hymns and Blanche scolds him for bringing her to see Clyde. - A longer version of Bonnie's visit home; she sits in the car and her sister gives her a perm (a portion of this-- Bonnie on the running board getting her hair put up-- exists in the final film). - A very long sequence in which Bonnie and Clyde get drunk and come to terms with their impending death. They trash their room and rip out the mattress from their bed, turning it into a makeshift coffin. They then put on their best clothes and put makeup on each other so they can see what they will look like when they're dead. The scene concludes with Bonnie and Clyde dancing around CW by candlelight and chanting \"The Hearse Song.\" - During the Platte City raid, C.W. uses a machine gun to attack the armored car instead of grenades. - The final shootout, in it's earliest form, was done entirely with still photos shown over sounds of machine gun fire and screams, and we never actually saw Bonnie or Clyde dead. The movie ended with the two farmers running towards the car while \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\" Played in the background.",

Seeing two doorman holding open the doors for customers, Bean seizes the opportunity and simply drives through the doors, around the inside of the store and then out the other side to get through the jam. - Bean pulling up to a 'No Parking' sign at his place of work, getting out a pair of false legs, pushing them underneath the car, and dropping some wrenches next to the legs to simulate his making repairs. - Bean hearing the news that he'll be going to America. He thinks that everyone will be carrying a gun so he makes believe he's holding a gun with his hands, and mimics Eastwood-like moves and even says to a man, \"Are you feeling lucky punk?\" - Bean reprising the 'head in the lap' gag in which he is wearing a blindfold to help him sleep while on the plane to America. He starts to fall down in his seat and then manages to have his head fall into the crotch of the passenger sitting next to him. The passenger yells for a stewardess to switch him to a different seat and Bean tries to make sense of the situation by screaming \"I'M BLIND!\" since he is still wearing the blindfold. - The Langley family falls asleep waiting for Bean at the airport. What they don't know is that Bean actually HAS arrived at their house by way of a Taxi. He gets inside and plays around with a remote control for what he thinks is the TV but is actually the garage door opener. Bean then picks up a SONY Walkman for the first time and then starts to listen to music and do an impromptu dance in his pajamas all over the house. - The Langley's arriving home and Bean using their bathroom. Bean and David continue a set of 'near misses' as one goes outside the room as another comes in. Bean, searching for his toothpaste, comes across what he thinks is David's toothpaste but is actually a tube of medicinal toe cream. Bean puts it on his toothbrush, brushes and after a bit smiles and says \"Mmmm! Nice!\" - A lot more of Bean's destroying of Whistler's mother (A lot of the pictures for this scene can be found in the books for the film) is shown. Bean going into the Grierson Gallery men's room and attempting to wash off the ink by using a toilet brush. Hearing others who want to use the facilities, Bean places the painting outside a window and onto the building's ledge. He then walks out on the ledge and tries to grab it while trying not to disrupt the security meeting with David, Elmer, George, Bernice, and Walter. - Bean tries to calm David's panic over the destroyed painting by coming up with the idea of placing a tiny piece of paper saying \"DO NOT COME IN\" on the doors. David's reaction to this is \"EXCELLENT! It's perfect! Problem is solved! Apart from one tiny drawback, that someone will eventually walk through that door, they'll see the painting and say, \"Oh look, someone has completely destroyed 'Whistler's Mother'. Let's Kill Them!!!\" leaving Bean at a loss for words. - A 'breakfast' scene at the Langley's shows Bean making scrambled eggs and toast for David and Andrew while David tries to think of what to say at the unveiling. \"I get to go in and tell everyone that 'Whistler's Mother' now looks like Pinocchio's Father!\" - An extended scene of Burt Reynolds' character General Newton meeting the staff of the Grierson Gallery including Bean.",

        "A \"Special Edition\" version was released in 1980 (3 years after the film's original theatrical release). The original production of \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" was plagued with schedule and budget problems. Spielberg originally wanted to release the film in the summer of 1978, however, Columbia Pictures (who were undergoing financial troubles at the time) insisted that Spielberg have it ready by November 1977. Therefore many scenes Spielberg had scripted couldn't be filmed as he originally intended due to time constraints. After the movie's huge success, Spielberg asked Columbia to allow him to re-cut the picture and to shoot additional sequences; the studio agreed at the condition that he included new scenes showing the inside of the alien mothership (to entice audiences into the theater again). Spielberg was given a budget of $1.5 million and seven weeks to shoot the new sequences (some of which were shot while he was also directing 1941 (1979)). He had to use a different director of photography (Allen Daviau) because Vilmos Zsigmond was unavailable, and he was able to convince most of the original cast to re-appear, with the exception of director Francois Truffaut (who played French scientist Lacombe) who was on location shooting a film at the time. For years, Steven Spielberg considered the Special Edition the only \"real\" version of the movie and dismissed the original as an inferior \"work-in-progress\". According to Columbia, all prints of the original version have been destroyed (apart from a few copies kept in the studio's vault for historical value only). Only the Special Edition had been the version available on video until Criterion became the first company to release different versions of the film in any video format. The following are the differences between the Original Version (O.V.) and the Special Edition (S.E.): - In the O.V. after Barry runs outside his house and into the night, there's a cut to a music box playing \"When you wish upon the star\" and then to Roy Neary's house, where he receives a phone call from his boss at the power station. In the S.E. after Barry leaves the house we see a panoramic shot of the city at night instead; the next scene shows Roy playing with a toy train in order to explain to his son what a fraction is. There's an argument between Roy, his wife and his kids (they want to go play Goofy Golf, he wants to go see \"Pinocchio\" but is outvoted). Then Roy's boss calls. - After Jillian Guiler looks for her son Barry in the woods, the O.V. version shows Roy Neary at the power station where workers are discussing the power failures and his supervisor tells him to go check an area of the city. The Special Edition deletes this scene. - The S.E. adds a new scene, after Roy see's the UFO flyby on the road: a UFO stops in front of a McDonald's sign and flashes its light on it, as if to read it. - An old man sees the UFOs fly by on the road and says \"They can fly rings around the moon, but we're years ahead of them on the highway\". This scene is missing from the S.E. - The S.E. adds a scene in which U.S. soldiers and scientists discover the ship, the \"Cotopaxi\" in the Gobi desert. This scene is inserted right after the one where Roy and his wife watch the sky in the spot where he first saw the UFOs. - A scene where Roy and his wife argue right after he's fired from his job. Roy lies on his bed and looks at a pillow (whose shape resembles the Devil's Tower mountain) The pillow segment was removed in the S.E. - The S.E. version changes the chronology of sequences from the mid-section of the O.V. In the O.V. the scene where Roy is fired is followed by the scene where he goes back to the road with his camera, which is followed by The India sequence and then Lacombe's auditorium speech. In the S.E. these scenes are flip-flopped. The scene where Roy is fired is followed by the India sequence, which is followed by Lacombe's auditorium speech, followed by the scene where Roy goes back to the road with his camera. - In the S.E. Lacombe's auditorium speech is slightly longer containing the applause of the dignitaries. - The S.E. deletes a scene at an Air Force base after Lacombe and the military argue about the best way to scare the population away from the alien's landing area. In the original Jillian is interviewed by reporters about her son's kidnapping, and Roy and Ronnie arrive at the base to attend a press conference about UFOs. Roy draws the shape of the Devil's Tower on a newspaper over the photo of Jillian and the headline \"Cosmic Kidnapping\". However, the headline is misspelled as 'kidnaping'. - In the O.V. during the dinner/mashed potato sequence. The scene begins with the kids arguing at the table. As soon as Roy walks into the room they immediately stop shouting. In the S.E. this portion is deleted and the scene begins with Ronnie handing Toby the mashed potatoes. - The S.E. adds a sequence where Roy breaks down and he locks himself in the bathroom and goes under the running shower. Ronnie breaks the door open and yells at him, holding him responsible for their family falling apart. - The scene where Roy tosses bricks and bushes into his house so he can make the Devil's tower replica was almost entirely removed in the S.E. version. The S.E. only includes the portion of the scene where Ronnie actually leaves with the kids. - When Ronnie leaves Roy and almost runs him over with her car, the O.V. shows him getting back inside the house from a window. This scene is missing from the S.E. The sequence when Roy arrives in Wyoming and meets Jillian at the train station while the population is being evacuated by the army is shorter in the S.E.: in the original we saw Roy trying to convince a soldier (played by Carl Weathers) to let him go look for his \"sister\": the guard says he has orders to shoot anyone that trespasses. - The S.E. adds a new ending that shows what happens after Roy enters the mothership, with light/sound special effects by Douglas Trumbull. - In the S.E. the end title music is different. Instead of the closing \"overture\" music originally commissioned for the credits, we hear an arrangement of \"When You Wish Upon A Star\".",

This is most noticeable in Season 4, where 7 of the 22 episodes have some type of edit. The German region 2 Season 4 set uses non-syndicated versions of these episodes, although the Dutch and French sets have the syndicated versions. The DVD box sets from Season 3 onward do not feature the original \"Love and Marriage\" theme song in the opening sequence. This was done because Sony was unable to obtain the rights to the theme song. It is highly unlikely that the theme song will return in any yet to be released DVD box set. The replaced theme song was the cause of the syndicated versions of seven episodes in Season 4, as Sony falsely claimed did not have access to the original masters of these episodes, and had to use syndicated prints. This is proved wrong since they used the originals from Season 4 in \"Most Outrageous\" DVDs that contained some episodes. As the end credits had to be altered to credit the new theme song, certain scenes that originally ran during the end credits had to be replaced with a freeze frame. In most episodes affected, the original audio plays in the background while you see a freeze frame, however in a few cases a freeze frame is used, but the original audio is replaced with the theme song.",

        "PART TWO of the extended cut of \"Beauty and the Obese\" starts with a \"Previously on Stripperella\" segment that runs almost two minutes. Other additions/changes include: - 1. The scene with Stripperella undercover at Dr. Cesaerian's as \"Sister Mary Hadalamb\" is extended slightly. The scene in the original ends after a close-up of Stripperella's face and goes to her night break-in of the office. The new stuff begins with Stripperella beating a hasty if clumsy retreat \"Well, I'd better go back to... where-ever nuns go.\" \"Church?\" \"Yeah! That place!\". Then we shift to the front door of the Tender Loins with the sign reading \"Open till 2 am... never clothed.\" We see the Siamese twins confronting the doorman. He reacts with shock, exclaiming \"Whoah! YOu're twice!\" He then rubs his eyes and says \"Now you're all blurry!\" to which the Brit wannabe, Cliff, responds nastily. The doorman asks for ID's, but Dave is the only one with a card and is granted enterance. When he is denied, Cliff complains \"You don't really need to see my ID. I'm clearly over twenty-one.\" Persephone then runs up, excited that Dave arrived, but is less enthused by Cliff's presence. The feeling is mutual as Cliff snarls, \"I return to London in the morning and my brother insisted that we spend my last night in a vulgar sleaze emporium!\", prompting an easperated response from Dave. The scene then moves inside of the club with the Siamese twins entered with Persephone as the bartender and Erotica watch. Erotica bemoans her friend's luck with men that the bartender sums up with the conclusion that she's easy(loose). Erotica corrects this charge with \"lucky\", wishing that she could meet a guy , fall in love, etc. She further mutters \"Sometimes I get so lonely, dancing and fighting crime(this second one catches the bartender's attention), that I just don't have time for a social life.\" The bartender asks about her statement 'fighting crime' that prompts Erotica to hastily say that she said GRIME and that she spends a lot of time cleaning around the house. She then leaves work AGAIN, saying goodbye to her boss. He tries to protest, but she ignores him totally and he gives up. This new addition is about 1 and 1/2 minutes. - 2. As she breaks into Dr. Cesaerian's office that night, some new dialogue inserted. As she cuts a hole into the front door's glass with a clawed glove, she mutters to herself \"Oh, I forgot that I can cut glass with my nipples! I could've broke a nail like this.\" Another dialogue addition happens when she picks the door to Room 3. She mutters, \"Oops, wrong finger.\" The scene is not extended timewise at all. - 3. The next new scene begins in the Tender Loins as the owner and the bartender discuss the 2-drink minimum policy and how it would adhere to the Siamese twins, with the owner asking if they should be charged for 2 or 4 drinks. The bartender says it doesn't matter since the British half has had WAY more than 4 drinks. Totally soused, Cliff suggests that they visit \"your naked tart of a girlfriend!\" Dragging Dave along reluctantly, Cliff drools and giggles mispronouncing Persephone's name and climbing up on the stage. Dave angrily chastises Cliff, and the two get into a fistfight. Confronted by the doorman Cliff is ordered out while Dave is allowed to stay, but Dave says he was leaving anyway. Outside the club, Persephone follows the two and ask to speak to Cliff alone. Dave turns away and Persephone asks what Cliff hates about her, insisting that she's not trying to come between them. Cliff admits that he's jealous of Dave. Since Dave was born first by a week (no, this doesn't make sense to me either or Persephone, seeing as they're Siamese twins)he always felt as if their parents loved Dave more. He then drunkenly rambles on about how while he was at Oxford, Dave was partying with women. This made him jealous because he never had success with women. He also admits that he's madly in love with her and bemoans that she'd probably never give him the time of day, saying mean things to her as a defense mechanism. She softens at that and hugs Cliff. This scene ends with drugged Striperella waking up in the doctor's basement lab and runs about 2 1/2 minutes. - 4. After Dr. Cesearian explains his rationale behind his actions, exclaiming \"Ooh, I HATE models!\" there is a dialogue extension where he continues \",,,and heights. But, that's neither here nor there. You can't really harm heights.\" - 5. In the VH-1 Fashion Awards, the announcer's line-up of stars is slightly different. In the original, ALF and others are mentioned, while the first listed in the two-parter is Tony Danza and others. - 6. When Dr. Cesaerian threatens to inject the now-freed Stripperella with cellulite, there is a new commercial break. After the break, the scene repeats the last line. - 7. There is a change in Kathie Lee Gifford's appearance on the Fashion Awards. In the original, her scene is black-and-white(implying that it's on a TV screen), but in the two-parter, she's announced and her scene is in color. - 8. In the race to the Fashion Awards, there is a slight scene extension. It starts after Woody Allen comes on stage at the Awards. Stripperella pulls up to a railroad crossing on her bike just as the barrier comes down and the train crosses. As she waits, a truck from \"Ramps Plus\" pulls up next to her with a huge ramp attached behind the trailer. She uses this to jump the train. As she lands on the other side, the train passes and the barrier goes up, exasperating her. This extension runs about 40 seconds. - 9. In the original concluding scene at the Tender Loins, a slight dialogue extension has Persephone bemoaning that Dave left her because she slept with his brother Cliff and somehow he found out. This lasts about 25 seconds. - 10. After the bartender muses \"I have a feeling we haven't seen the last of Stripperella.\" the original episode ends, but in the two-parter there is an extension showing Erotica backstage pulling the bag of Dr. Cesaerian's face parts (all that was left of him after his lab mysteriously exploded)out of her pocket and saying, \"I don't think we've seen the last of YOU, Dr. Cesaerian.\" The scene then shifts to a train station where we see an extremely fat and trench-coated figure boards a train to Italy. It is Dr. Cesaerian, and he literally sneezes his nose off before replacing it and boarding the train. - 11. The words \"The End\" are actually shown before the credits. - PART TWO runs about 21 and 1/2 minutes, with commercials excised. The whole thing runs about 43 and 1/2 minutes total.",

        "The director's cut (2002) adds the following scenes (twenty minutes in total): - When Salieri talks of his initial success in Vienna, a section has been added where Salieri describes how he believed God had accepted his vow, and how he honored it, working hard and often for free, while staying chaste. - When Salieri describes his first impression of Mozart's music to the priest, a shot has been added, where Salieri expresses his denial, saying that the music couldn't be anything but an \"accident\". - After the performance of \"Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail\", the scene has been extended after Caterina Cavalieri storms off of the stage, with Wolfgang getting a bucket of water and throwing over Frau Weber. After that a scene has been added where Salieri and Mozart visits Cavalieri in her lodge. Caterina throws some surly remarks about Constanze before she too comes and asks that she and Mozart go home. Mozart walks out on Caterina, and the scene goes to Salieri saying that he knew Mozart \"had had her\". - When Salieri asks \"What was God up to?\", the monologue has been extended, with Salieri speculating that it might be a test by God. - After Salieri admits to have started to hate Mozart, a shot has been inserted of Salieri praying, asking that Mozart be sent to Salzburg. This is immediately followed by the shot of the archbishop telling Leopold that he won't take Mozart back. - After Mozart refuses to submit his work for the royal appointment, a scene has been added showing Wolfgang and Constanze arguing. This establishes that the couple is in need of money. - When Constanze goes to visit Salieri in secret, the scene has been extended, starting with Salieri teaching a student. - The biggest addition comes after Constanze asks if Salieri will help them; instead of just walking out on her, he says says that she must come to his place, alone in the evening, strongly implying they must have sex for him to recommend Mozart's on the committee. - The scene switches to Salieri praying at his clavichord as Constanze arrives. She begins to undress, with Salieri looking shocked. When she is half-nude, Salieri calls in his valet and tells him to escort Constanze out. Humiliated and furious she throws a candelabra after him. Wolfgang finds Constanze crying in bed at home. This explains why Constanze is so eager to throw Salieri out of her home at the end of the movie. - Another large section is added where Salieri implies to the emperor that Mozart has been molesting young female students. This results in someone else getting the royal appointment. Mozart comes to see Salieri, receiving the news. Mozart asks Salieri for a loan, again establishing that he needs money. Salieri recommends Mozart give lessons to a Herr Schlumberg's daughter. The lesson however turns out a major frustration for Mozart, with Herr Schlumberg's dogs howling and causing a ruckus. - A scene has been added where Salieri and Baron Van Swieten discuss Mozart's financial difficulties. This is followed by a shot of a drunken Mozart again visiting Herr Schlumberg, asking if he may give lessons and - when denied - asks for a loan. That request is denied as well.",

Although the script was never finished some of the original material from the script by Wein and Charbin was shot but ultimately cut from Ciao! Manhattan. These scenes are now featured on the DVD 30th Anniversary edition as \"The Lost Reels\" and include: - Missing Subplot: In \"Stripped and Strapped,\" Susan, played by Edie Sedgwick, had a friend played by Nena Thurman (mother of actress Uma Thurman) who was involved in an incestuous relationship with her brother. Scenes of them together are show in a kitchen. - Another part of the missing subplot included Susan's obsession with astrological signs and things of an other worldy nature. In the Lost Reels, scenes are shown of Susan (Edie) in a room painted wall to floor with strange astrology and hand signs, talking with Allen Ginsberg. These scenes like the incestuous brother and sister were written by Chuck Wein who was inspired by Andy Warhol, who did films about nothing, and so Wein wrote these scenes to be about nothing. - Additional unfinished footage: - Scenes of Susan (Edie) at the \"Be-In\" were originally longer and featured her climbing a rock and socializing with the hippie crowd. - Aerial shots of Manhattan, which in 1967 looked industrial and more concrete, taken in a helicopter rented from the Pan-Am building of the time. - Scenes of Nena Thurman and Susan(Edie) shop-lifting at downtown Manhattan store Paraphernalia. - Scenes of Susan(Edie) having a \"bitch fight\" with Baby Jane Holzer after Susan returns home to the Chelsea Hotel from shop-lifting at Paraphernalia. - Susan and Paul America eating sushi at one of the first sushi bars in late 60s Manhattan. - More scenes of Edie and Paul America wandering New York. Also included are some night shots of Edie at a fountain. - David Weisman was also featured in the film much longer before editing and included: Scenes of him at his home with Nena Thurman, Edie, Paul America and some friends of his getting high. David shows off his Samuri sword, apparently he had an obsession with Kurosawa films. Also a scene of David with his Manhattan \"Scenesters\" is shown. - Three dancers are shown dancing in front of Mario with a monkey. - Allen Ginsberg's appearance at the \"Medium Convention\" was origanlly much longer and featured him performing one of his monologues. - Some shots of Paul America in a car, picking up and dropping off Baby Jane Holzer at the heloport, he gets angry and takes off in the car and isn't seen again for a few years. - The only existing footage of the interior of famed Max's Kansas City was found among the reels and is featured here. - Some beautiful black and white footage of women in the cotumes/dresses of the Silver Sixties are shown at night in the cold fog. - Missing color footage included: A shot of Edie falling over while dancing in front of Butch, she spills the cup of vodka she is drinking on the mattress at the bottom of the pool.",

        "The DVD includes six extended/deleted scenes: - A scene of Will, Roland and Wat around a campfire during the training, where Will comes up with the idea for sir Ulrich's crest: a phoenix. Wat and Roland say there should be three phoenixes, since there's three of them. - Lord Adhemar's original introduction scene, where he slaps around one of his servants while having his armor fitted, and reference is made to the \"triple phoenix\" design of Sir Ulrich's crest. - Chaucer giving another substantial introduction for Sir Ulrich, similar to the first one, right before his match with Lord Adhemar. He berates Adhemar's herald before the speech; after the speech, Adhemar's herald appears impressed, which leads to his imitation of Chaucer's style later in the film. - When Adhemar leaves the dance, we find out the reason for his pained expression; in a deleted scene, he reveals to a monk that he is tone-deaf, and has never been able to hear music as anything more than noise. Adhemar then strides out into the midst of the poor, waiting outside the castle for handouts, and starts a riot by throwing food and money into the crowd. - Another deleted scene has Will, Roland, Wat, and Kate seeing Chaucer walking back to their quarters naked again. They follow him, but it turns that he was fetching food for his wife, Phillipa (who is also naked), and had not lost his clothes gambling like they thought. They leave, laughing, and run into Jocelyn and Christiana. Christiana and Roland leave together (with a suggestion of romance), William and Jocelyn leave together, but when Wat holds out his hand for Kate, she just hands him a pastry and walks off. Wat says \"Hey, Beautiful\" to the pastry and walks off happy anyway. - The original version of the scene with William in the stocks is considerably longer, and has an extensive speech by Chaucer (which is probably his best in the film). Rather than having the crowd calmed by the appearance of Prince Edward, the crowd is converted by Chaucer's speech, and has already begun chanting \"William, William!\" by the time the Prince reveals himself. A much stronger version of the scene, but cut down in favor of having the Prince's role expanded.",

A shot of a cutting torch being picked up just after the main logo is missing. Two Face's reply after the guard says \"You said you'd let me live\" is missing. After the 'punctual funeral' line, Two Face shouting \"Kill the Bat!\" has been removed from the soundtrack and replaced with music and guards grunting. When the elevator dings just before Batman exits, Two Face's shout of \"Blast him!\" was not present in the UK version. The fight outside the elevator has lost a lot of sound effects, as well as a sequence where Batman drops his leg sharply onto a thug's chest, complete with a loud thud. Batman delivering a backward head butt and breaking a thug's nose in extreme close-up has been removed. Close-ups of kicks to midriffs and faces are also missing. Two Face's lines in the helicopter about the acid have been removed. In the sequence where the helicopter pilot is killed, Two Face emptying an entire clip into the helicopter pilot has been trimmed, along with shots showing the bullets riddling the pilot's body from the front. The cut UK version had only three shots fired, and the pilot is shown slumping from behind. The death of Stickley does not show him stopping on the window ledge, and hanging in terror, before Nygma runs over and says \"Fred, babe! You are fired! Or should I say...terminated?\". With this, he pulls the hat off him and he falls down, but this was all cut from the UK print. Two Face's line in the circus big top was cut from the UK version, \"Our new act for your personal amazement: we call it - Massacre Under The Big Top!\". A shot of Nygma laughing at the above line is also missing. When the Mayor asks what Two Face wants at the circus, his reply is shortened from \"Batman - bruised, broken, bleeding. In a word, dead!\" to simply \"Batman\". The UK version is missing the sequence where Bruce Wayne kills one guard on the right side of the big drum by coming up behind him, breaking his neck, and smacking him in the face as he falls. When Two Face flips his coin before killing the Graysons, after his evil laugh he goes on to say \"Their kind of day\", which was missing in the UK version. As the bomb is raised through the roof of the circus, a quick sequence of Bruce flipping a guard over and kicking him hard in the gut is missing. When Two Face accidentally kills two of his men in the car, their screams have been cut short in the UK version, and a shot of the driver's terrified face has been removed. The fight at Nygma's party loses some impact sounds. Shortly after this, Batman makes a guard do the splits and another crack accompanies this, but the sound has virtually been eliminated from the soundtrack. A small crack has been greatly reduced in volume as Batman twists a thug's arm backwards Robin throwing Two Face a vicious head butts after the line, \"This is for me!\" has been replaced in the UK version, by removing the punch Robin throws after he says \"This is for my brother\" and reinserting in place of the head butt.",

Soon after, Bruce arrives and finds Carl tied to a tree still alive, rather than hanging dead from an overhanging branch. Aside from this, Feng's death is far more graphic showing a pseudo-X-Ray shot of Bruce's index finger buried into Feng's heart. Bruce then pulls his finger out, causing the heart to squirt out blood and then finally finishes off Feng with two fingers stabbing his throat, and Feng spitting out blood. Shortly after Feng falls dead to the ground, Carl runs over to Bruce and says \"Hey man, okay?\". The shot then freeze frames with Bruce and Carl looking off into the horizon with the end of the \"theme\" (Bill Conti's \"The Final Bell\" from Rocky) playing. While unconfirmed, it is likely the upbeat, albeit more violent, ending was used for the limited unrated US release (under the title Kung Fu Avengers) while the downbeat, but cut, ending was used originally for the wide R-rated US release (under the more popular title of Soul Brothers of Kung Fu) as well as the UK release.",

However, Scott was in post production on _1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992)_ (qv) and in preproduction on _Thelma & Louise (1991)_ (qv), and he was unable to devote all his time to the project. As such, Scott always felt that even this altered version of the film, fell short of his true intentions, something he was finally able to rectify with the 2007 Final Cut. The main differences between the Director's Cut and the US Theatrical Cut include: - the Director's Cut completely deletes all Deckard voice-overs - while Deckard waits for a seat at the noodlebar, the voice from the advertising blimp goes on longer than in the original version (to fill the void from the missing voice over) and adds the phrase \"This announcement is brought to you by the Shimata-Dominguez Corporation -- helping America into the New World.\" - there is a 12 second scene showing a unicorn while Deckard plays the piano - the happy ending is gone, instead the film ends when the elevator doors close.",
