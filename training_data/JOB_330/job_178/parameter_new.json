In desperation, Roberts stops a yellow cab and shows his badge, argues with the uncooperative cabbie to use it, and eventually decks the cabbie in the face to take control of the cab and quickly pursues the escaping drug pusher, ending with Roberts following the unsuspecting Scott on foot. - After the Christmas visit with Charlie Williams, there's an extended scene with Frank and Eva back at their home, where Frank reminisces how Bumpy gradually stayed more and more at home towards the end of his life because of constant police surveillance. He then asks Eva if she wants to go out, nevertheless. - An extended ending in 1991 where Lucas upon release from jail is picked up by Roberts, and the two make their way towards the intersection of 116 St. and Frederick Douglass Blvd, conversing while drinking lattes.",

        "Following attacks from politicians on violent films aimed at children, Warner Brothers. pushed the release date back and recut the film to a tamer version, toning down some of the violence in the original cut sent out in screener tapes. On April 23, 2001, the unedited version of the film was released in the US exclusively on DVD. Up until that point the uncut version had only been released as screeners that were sent out before the changes were made. The following are scenes that were changed in the edited-for-content version: - Lots of white flashes have been added to the action sequences where there were previously none. Additionally, combinations of punches have been mostly trimmed down to one punch. For example, Woof slashes the guard once now instead of twice. Batman no longer punches Ghoul in the gut, he just uppercuts him into the dish. Later on in the club, Terry's vicious attack on Ghoul is cut to a flash and Terry running away while Ghoul falls. There is a 360-degree fight sequence in the opening battle that has also been removed, where Batman fends off the Jokerz one by one. - Seat belts added to Terry and Bruce as the drive home after their first meeting with the new Joker. - Bonk is not shot, but given a lethal dose of laughing gas, and he dies off screen. Because of this the whole \"Take the trash outside, Dee Dee\" and \"Are you with me?\" sequence is cut. - When Bruce throws the batarang it appears as though he's pleased he can still throw & catch a batarang instead of it showing him using it to decapitate a Two Face dummy. - When Terry enters the Batcave to find it demolished by the Joker, the letter's 'HA! HA!' written across the floor are changed from red to purple. Probably to assure us it is not written on Bruce's blood. - All other blood is removed. (Only one example was passed over. In the flashback sequence when Batman smashes through the projection he smacks the Joker. Blots of blood fly from the Jokers mouth, but he is not bleeding in the next shot.) - In the unedited version, when Batman (in the present) frees himself from the Jokers' ribbon wrap, he throws the knife that he used to free himself with at the Joker. The Joker ducks at the last second and the blade goes through the stage curtain. This would explain the hole behind the Joker. - The Joker is not shot, but slips in some water and is electrocuted off screen. Plus, they don't mention they buried him deep under Arkham or any of that. The dialogue is completely changed in that sequence. - Barbara says that Leslie Thompkins helped Tim Drake \"regain himself\" instead of \"regain his sanity.\" (or something along those lines) - During a montage where Batman and Batgirl comb \"the underworld\" looking for clues about Robin's disappearance, Batgirl talks to a nicely-dressed man and woman instead of two sleazily-dressed women (who are pretty obviously hookers) on a street corner. - Also, Joker no longer slices Batman across the chest of in the leg, and any blood is digitally removed. Joker just punches Batman. - More than half of the \"Our Family Memories\" is cut out, only showing Robin tied up and struggling, and cutting the scene where Joker opens the barbeque lids, picks up the voltage tongs, and shocks the Boy. - A lot of dialogue is changed as well. And reference to the word \"kill\" is changed. - The opening fight seqeunce is trimmed, cutting out a second Dee-Dee kick and completely redoing that entire Batman/Dee Dee sequence. - The club fight is changed. The pink clown no longer punches Terry and says \"I don't know why the boss wants a dreg like you outta the way, but as long as it's fun...\". He just goes for his gun and says \"Slag him!\". - Bruce says \"Robin defeated him.\" instead of \"Robin did kill him\". Joker says \"Bat-Kook\" instead of \"Bat-Fart\". Jordan Price says \"Ice\" instead of \"kill\". Tim Drake says \"I can still hear his scream\" instead of \"I can still hear the shot\". Joker says \"...with such yutzes\" instead of \"...with such putzes\". - In the scene where the satellite laser chases the Batmoblie it blasts an unmarked, dark, seemingly empty building. Originally it was a lit movie theater. (In the edited version the word 'cineplex' can be seen exploding out of the wreckage in the last few frames of the shot.) - The clothing on 'Nanna Harley' is changed from blue and purple to Harley Quinn's trademark red and black.",

Grace informs Norm and Jake about it. - The squad reaches the abandoned school. It reveals that Grace teaches English to the Na'vi children until a serious incident came about (bullet holes around, etc..) which was insinuated about. - Jake and Neytiri tripping through the neon-light woods is slightly longer. - When Jake joins the circle, a little Na'vi girl smiles at him curiously, but her father holds her back. Neytiri then arrives and hands Jake a fruit. - Jake tries to ask Neytiri her name, but she seems annoyed by that. - Jake, Grace and Norm proceed from the helicopter to the secluded laboratory. There's an explanation about the mountains. - At night, Jake and Neytiri run through the luminescent forest. - After Jake touches the Fan Lizard, it flies away in a radiant glow. Its fellow species follow suit and, to the delight of Jake and Neytiri, raise themselves into the air. - As Jake and the other Na'vi climb the mountain, Neytiri flies past them on a Seze. - The Na'vi goes for an aerial hunt for Stuurmbeast. Jake shoots one and exclaims in excitement. Neytiri follow suit as well. - The Na'vi destroy the Hell Trucks of the mining company. - The next morning, Wainfleet's squad sifts through the remains of the Hell Trucks. Turns out that Na'vi kill the soldiers as well. Quaritch and Selfridge watch the live broadcast. - Tsu'tey's fall from the sky is longer. A few plants decelerate and break his fall. - The Hammerhead Titanotheres has been extended. - The fight between Neytiri on a Thanathor and Quaritch is slightly longer. - Tsu'Tey's death: he knows he is dying and appoints Jake to be his successor. He insists Jake to kill him because by Na'vi customs, Jake has to pass him to the Eywa by killing him by his own hands. Neytiri starts to cry. Jake reluctantly complies with his wish, stabbing him by the knife as the camera passes by him. - The end credits has an addition of using Discovery Zone's Bless the Plague soundtrack.

The musical score is the original Vladimir Kraus-Rajteric score which kicks in very rarely. The scenes are rearranged so that Welles makes his speech to the troops near the beginning and the air attack hits Bihac simultaneously with the land battle. Almost every dialog scene is lengthened and cut slower than the English version, but there are some parts of the action scenes cut a lot tighter. For instance, this is missing the scene where Riva falls out of the truck during the Italian retreat. It is also missing the scene in the Orthodox church prior the Welles addressing the Chetniks. However, it does feature several new scenes, most notably a scene where Vasco raids a house in Prosor only to then shoot and wound his own commander, and then a second battle between the Partisans and the Italians. In this scene, Riva refuses to fire at his own men and Novak almost shoots him only for Martin to intervene. General Morelli is captured and then promptly commits suicide with a pistol. There is also a new scene where the partisans surprise attack a group of Chetniks guarding the Neretva bridge. There are several more violent shots missing from other prints - such as the Ustashans hanging an old woman and laughing when they march through Bihac. There are several more deaths during the end battle with the Chetniks such as a partisan being shot in the back when reaching for a grenade. Then at the end of the battle there is a scene where a partisan named 'Stipe' goes crazy and guns down a number of Chetnik prisoners, only to have his rank stripped from him. Curiously almost all the nationalities speak their own language; with Riva speaking Italian even with his Yugoslavian captors and Morelli speaking in German when addressing General Lohring. The only actors dubbed appear to be Yul Brynner and Orson Welles.",

The Frank version, one of his usual dubbing jobs, was the whole original Japanese footage except for the opening credits sequence, replaced by English translated credits superimposed over an image of moving oceanwater.

        "PART TWO of the extended cut of \"Beauty and the Obese\" starts with a \"Previously on Stripperella\" segment that runs almost two minutes. Other additions/changes include: - 1. The scene with Stripperella undercover at Dr. Cesaerian's as \"Sister Mary Hadalamb\" is extended slightly. The scene in the original ends after a close-up of Stripperella's face and goes to her night break-in of the office. The new stuff begins with Stripperella beating a hasty if clumsy retreat \"Well, I'd better go back to... where-ever nuns go.\" \"Church?\" \"Yeah! That place!\". Then we shift to the front door of the Tender Loins with the sign reading \"Open till 2 am... never clothed.\" We see the Siamese twins confronting the doorman. He reacts with shock, exclaiming \"Whoah! YOu're twice!\" He then rubs his eyes and says \"Now you're all blurry!\" to which the Brit wannabe, Cliff, responds nastily. The doorman asks for ID's, but Dave is the only one with a card and is granted enterance. When he is denied, Cliff complains \"You don't really need to see my ID. I'm clearly over twenty-one.\" Persephone then runs up, excited that Dave arrived, but is less enthused by Cliff's presence. The feeling is mutual as Cliff snarls, \"I return to London in the morning and my brother insisted that we spend my last night in a vulgar sleaze emporium!\", prompting an easperated response from Dave. The scene then moves inside of the club with the Siamese twins entered with Persephone as the bartender and Erotica watch. Erotica bemoans her friend's luck with men that the bartender sums up with the conclusion that she's easy(loose). Erotica corrects this charge with \"lucky\", wishing that she could meet a guy , fall in love, etc. She further mutters \"Sometimes I get so lonely, dancing and fighting crime(this second one catches the bartender's attention), that I just don't have time for a social life.\" The bartender asks about her statement 'fighting crime' that prompts Erotica to hastily say that she said GRIME and that she spends a lot of time cleaning around the house. She then leaves work AGAIN, saying goodbye to her boss. He tries to protest, but she ignores him totally and he gives up. This new addition is about 1 and 1/2 minutes. - 2. As she breaks into Dr. Cesaerian's office that night, some new dialogue inserted. As she cuts a hole into the front door's glass with a clawed glove, she mutters to herself \"Oh, I forgot that I can cut glass with my nipples! I could've broke a nail like this.\" Another dialogue addition happens when she picks the door to Room 3. She mutters, \"Oops, wrong finger.\" The scene is not extended timewise at all. - 3. The next new scene begins in the Tender Loins as the owner and the bartender discuss the 2-drink minimum policy and how it would adhere to the Siamese twins, with the owner asking if they should be charged for 2 or 4 drinks. The bartender says it doesn't matter since the British half has had WAY more than 4 drinks. Totally soused, Cliff suggests that they visit \"your naked tart of a girlfriend!\" Dragging Dave along reluctantly, Cliff drools and giggles mispronouncing Persephone's name and climbing up on the stage. Dave angrily chastises Cliff, and the two get into a fistfight. Confronted by the doorman Cliff is ordered out while Dave is allowed to stay, but Dave says he was leaving anyway. Outside the club, Persephone follows the two and ask to speak to Cliff alone. Dave turns away and Persephone asks what Cliff hates about her, insisting that she's not trying to come between them. Cliff admits that he's jealous of Dave. Since Dave was born first by a week (no, this doesn't make sense to me either or Persephone, seeing as they're Siamese twins)he always felt as if their parents loved Dave more. He then drunkenly rambles on about how while he was at Oxford, Dave was partying with women. This made him jealous because he never had success with women. He also admits that he's madly in love with her and bemoans that she'd probably never give him the time of day, saying mean things to her as a defense mechanism. She softens at that and hugs Cliff. This scene ends with drugged Striperella waking up in the doctor's basement lab and runs about 2 1/2 minutes. - 4. After Dr. Cesearian explains his rationale behind his actions, exclaiming \"Ooh, I HATE models!\" there is a dialogue extension where he continues \",,,and heights. But, that's neither here nor there. You can't really harm heights.\" - 5. In the VH-1 Fashion Awards, the announcer's line-up of stars is slightly different. In the original, ALF and others are mentioned, while the first listed in the two-parter is Tony Danza and others. - 6. When Dr. Cesaerian threatens to inject the now-freed Stripperella with cellulite, there is a new commercial break. After the break, the scene repeats the last line. - 7. There is a change in Kathie Lee Gifford's appearance on the Fashion Awards. In the original, her scene is black-and-white(implying that it's on a TV screen), but in the two-parter, she's announced and her scene is in color. - 8. In the race to the Fashion Awards, there is a slight scene extension. It starts after Woody Allen comes on stage at the Awards. Stripperella pulls up to a railroad crossing on her bike just as the barrier comes down and the train crosses. As she waits, a truck from \"Ramps Plus\" pulls up next to her with a huge ramp attached behind the trailer. She uses this to jump the train. As she lands on the other side, the train passes and the barrier goes up, exasperating her. This extension runs about 40 seconds. - 9. In the original concluding scene at the Tender Loins, a slight dialogue extension has Persephone bemoaning that Dave left her because she slept with his brother Cliff and somehow he found out. This lasts about 25 seconds. - 10. After the bartender muses \"I have a feeling we haven't seen the last of Stripperella.\" the original episode ends, but in the two-parter there is an extension showing Erotica backstage pulling the bag of Dr. Cesaerian's face parts (all that was left of him after his lab mysteriously exploded)out of her pocket and saying, \"I don't think we've seen the last of YOU, Dr. Cesaerian.\" The scene then shifts to a train station where we see an extremely fat and trench-coated figure boards a train to Italy. It is Dr. Cesaerian, and he literally sneezes his nose off before replacing it and boarding the train. - 11. The words \"The End\" are actually shown before the credits. - PART TWO runs about 21 and 1/2 minutes, with commercials excised. The whole thing runs about 43 and 1/2 minutes total.",

Clocking in at 100 minutes (the DVD packaging incorrectly lists the running time at 93 minutes), the DVD version is a full 11 minutes longer than the US theatrical cut.  Scenes in the DVD not present in the theatrical version include a bathroom sex scene between Ryan Phillippe and Selma Hayek, an extension of the sex scene between Phillippe and Sela Ward, and extensions of other scenes that play up the love triangle between Phillippe, Hayek, and Breckin Meyer. Many of these extensions were part of director Mark Christopher's original version of the film, greatly changed and edited before theatrical release.",

New villains came in the form of giant space slugs involved in organized crime; - Almost all character building scenes were removed to make it an entirely action oriented show; - April and Splinter's roles were diminished considerably; - The turtles voices were altered to sound more deep and aggressive; - The cartoon feel of the show was removed--The sky was changed from blue with white clouds to red with gray clouds and buildings were drawn as if destroyed; - Irma, Verne, April's boss, Baxter Stockman, Ratking, and numerous other characters were totally removed from the show; - In addition, the opening sequence was hiked up, changing the music to a techno beat with flashing lights and scenes from the Tutles movies intercut with new scenes from the show.",

        "This film was re-released in IMAX and other large format theaters on January 1, 2002. The following changes were made to the film for this release: - The \"In Association with Silver Screen Partners IV\" credit is replaced with \"The Special Edition Of--\" on the opening title sequence. The 2002 DVD omits this credit & the Walt Disney Pictures Presents credit stays on screen. - The animation in some of the scenes went back through the clean-up animation department a second time, to correct problems such as wavering lines and missing details, which, while not very noticeable during a traditional 35mm showing of the film, would have been discomforting on a much large IMAX screen. Small details, such as the blood in Beast's wound after his fight with the wolves, were also added. - The Beast's \"stutter\" (\"You wan-wanna stay in the tower?\"), a sound editing mistake, was corrected (\"You wanna stay in the tower?\"). - Six minutes of new footage was added between the songs \"Something There\" and \"Beauty and the Beast,\" most of which is made up of a new musical sequence, \"Human Again.\" This song was written by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken for the original version of the film, but cut for continuity purposes. After Alan Menken altered the song to make it work for the Broadway stage version of Beauty and the Beast, the song was worked back into the film. - During the \"Human Again\" song sequence, the household objects clean up the Beast's castle, which necessitated having the background artists go back and digitally re-paint the backgrounds for the castle scenes that followed so that the castle was clean. - The animation for Cogsworth's line to the Beast after Belle is freed (\"Yes-yes-yes, but...why?\") was completely re-done, as the directors never liked how the animation looked in the original version. - New sound effects are added to the shot where Belle and Phillippe leave the castle to find Maurice, which are supposed to suggest that the Beast trashes his room in anguish (and also so that the backgrounds from this point on would not have to be repainted). - The longer credits necessitated the addition of an additional passage of score music, the version of the 'Transformation' theme that was cut out of the original film, to the end of the film.",

In the unrated version, it just moves on to Bud's meditation. - An additional scene of conversation between Jerry, Dave and Bud. Dave and Jerry notice the surfboards on Bud's patio and he says that he still surfs every now and then but is more into \"cosmic surfing.\" - A scene where Xena asks Dave what Bud is doing. Dave replies that Bud is meditating, and briefly explains what that is. Dave then introduces the Beach Babes to Uncle Bud. Bud asks if the Beach Babes want to stay for dinner, to which Dave says he's sure they would love it. Xena consider going back to the T-Bird ship, until Luna declares that it is the perfect opportunity for a \"social studies\" project. - A scene showing Bud going into his house to mix up a remedy for Jerry's sunburn. In the unrated version, this scene is missing entirely and just cuts to Bud applying the remedy to Jerry's sunburn. - A scene where Bud unsuccessfully tries to reason with Sally to give him more time to fix up his home. Sally tells Bud that she is angry with him for not marrying him. Sally then calls Hassler to talk about Bud's visit and how he refuses to change his place. Hassler gives Sally some suggestions, which do not fare well with Sally. After the call, we see a woman walk up to Hassler and Hassler asks \"So where were we?\". The woman replies with they were going to get the agrees. Hassler replies with \"Oh, yeah.\" - A scene with Bud's house being condemned. The city official (Played by Lenny Rose, who would later go on to play James T. Renford II in the sequel), tells Bud that he'll work something out for Bud to stay at his place until Monday to get the house fixed.

        "For the most part the episodes on the North American DVD box sets are the unedited versions as seen on the FOX network, however there are some instances where scenes have been cut or the syndicated version of an episode was placed on the DVD instead. This is most noticeable in Season 4, where 7 of the 22 episodes have some type of edit. The German region 2 Season 4 set uses non-syndicated versions of these episodes, although the Dutch and French sets have the syndicated versions. The DVD box sets from Season 3 onward do not feature the original \"Love and Marriage\" theme song in the opening sequence. This was done because Sony was unable to obtain the rights to the theme song. It is highly unlikely that the theme song will return in any yet to be released DVD box set. The replaced theme song was the cause of the syndicated versions of seven episodes in Season 4, as Sony falsely claimed did not have access to the original masters of these episodes, and had to use syndicated prints. This is proved wrong since they used the originals from Season 4 in \"Most Outrageous\" DVDs that contained some episodes. As the end credits had to be altered to credit the new theme song, certain scenes that originally ran during the end credits had to be replaced with a freeze frame. In most episodes affected, the original audio plays in the background while you see a freeze frame, however in a few cases a freeze frame is used, but the original audio is replaced with the theme song.",

        "Some of the main differences between the 20th Century Fox aka theatrical version and Studio Canal aka unrated version are as follows: - The opening sequence monologue of Toorop is different. The narration in the unrated version matches the cyberpunk tone of the movie and denounces God. - The unrated version follows with a sequence of Toorop waking up in his flat and having breakfast before he sets out to the rainy street, which is where the theatrical version starts. - On the train to Vladivostok the unrated version includes a scene of an encounter with a herdsman's family from whom Toorop tries to buy-off their seats. - In the Vladivostok club all the sequences of Aurora's encounters with the fighter are edited differently. The unrated edition employs more close-ups to establish the connection between them, whereas the theatrical version uses mainly wide shots. - The fight between Toorop and the fighter is also edited differently. The unrated version has more shots of Toorop hitting the fighter to fit better with his not so much of a clear-cut hero image. - The snowmobile chase is different in the two versions. The theatrical version features more spectacular stunt shots and shows Toorop more as an unbeatable action hero. - Before the sequence in the tent where they all enjoy the food, the unrated version features a shot of Toorop shooting a cute rabbit. The theatrical version does not explain where they got the meat. - The unrated version follows the shower scene in the Canadian motel with the scene of the High Priestess undergoing plastic surgery which was included in the theatrical version at the beginning after the group left the monastery (in the unrated version after this scene follows a montage of wide shots of the car cruising the landscape). The unrated edition omits the whole sequence on the Canadian airport. - The sequence of Toorop's memory scanning in the unrated version is much longer, revealing his whole past and his terrorist activities, including 9/11. After the scanning the unrated version includes a dialogue scene with Toorop and Darquandier elaborating on Aurora's babies and the next step of mankind's evolution. The scene concludes with Darquandier's troops informing them about the short arrival of the High Priestess (this part is included in the theatrical version after the death of Gorsky). - The unrated version omits the climatic action sequence with the Hummer chase and also the kitschy happy ending with Toorop and the two babies. The unrated version ends with Toorop's narration after his reunion with Aurora and than follows with a much longer scene in the hospital. This ending is true to the spirit of cyberpunk. - Also many tracking shots in the film are significantly longer in the unrated edition, making it more focused on the society and the world of the future in comparison to the action-oriented theatrical version.",

All the scenes of them entering the Bay, including the reference to \"his charts\" (the missionary's), were cut. They cut all references to the \"flying missionary\" who was a German spy, the scenes with the map and all of it. They also cut the other \"delicate\" passage there, where Hirth tells the captive Canadians that the Eskimos are sub-apes like Negroes, only one step above the Jews, and the ripostes from Johnnie and the Factor.

West Coast: This time, Baldwin doesn't pick up anything until he gets the line out first. - 2. East Coast: In a flashback, Julia Louis-Dreyfus references _Slumdog Millionaire (2008)_ (qv) by calling to Jonathan with, \"Yeah, Chai Boy, get in here. You'll never be a millionaire.\" West Coast: Instead, Louis-Dreyfus references _Aladdin (1992)_ (qv) by saying, \"Hurry up, Aladdin, before Jasmine is forced to marry Jafar!\" - 3. East Coast: Jane Krakowski sings the 30 Rock opening, which has lyrics questioning the wisdom of throwing a live show. West Coast: Cheyenne Jackson sings the 30 Rock opening, incorporating region-specific lines like \"Let's talk about sushi\" and \"Portland, Vegas, Glendale, this is 30 Rock!\" - 4. East Coast: There's a bad boom mic shadow at the end of the Rachel Dratch elevator scene. West Coast: Fixed! - 5. East Coast: Liz tells Tracy, \"Audiences love it when something goes wrong,\" and the Who Dat Ninja poster swings lazily in the background a beat too late. West Coast: The poster cue gets nailed. - 6. East Coast: As Liz leaves his dressing room, Tracy tells his entourage, \"Gentlemen, tonight I'm gonna laugh harder than I did at Dotcom's play.\" West Coast: Tracy Morgan totally butchers the line, realizes it, and starts grinning. - 7. East Coast: Jenna tells Pete about her song, \"It's Your Birthday, Slut.\" West Coast: Jane Krakowski forgets the \"slut\" part of her line briefly, but recovers. - 8. East Coast: According to online surveys, Jack \"has a drinking problem.\" West Coast: According to online surveys, Jack \"is a problem drinker.\" The difference is small but profound. - 9. East Coast: During TGS's Fox News sketch, the chyron for President Obama reads, \"Exclusive Interview with Kenyan Liar.\" West Coast: This time, it reads \"Impartial Interview with Barack Obammunist.\" - 10. East Coast: In his commercial, Dr. Spaceman's first song includes the line, \"Light some candles, draw a bath, and start off with full-on intercourse.\" West Coast: It's been revised to \"Light some candles, draw a bath, and tie me to my radiator and put food just out of reach.\" - 11. East Coast: Spaceman's second song goes, \"Baby, let's let the dog watch us. Do you think he understands the love that we have? Oops, I'm finished, call yourself a cab.\" West Coast: Now it's \"Girl, I've been knowing you a long time, and I think tonight's the night / This time, you can be the man.\" - 12. East Coast: Matt Damon's first appearance in the show gets wild cheers at the beginning and end of his scene. West Coast: Complete silence from the audience. - 13. East Coast: A paint-sniffing Jack tells Liz, \"Men need alcohol. It's the first thing every civilization makes, along with weapons and shelters to enjoy prostitutes.\" West Coast: This time, Jack says, \"Men need alcohol. It gives us the ability to hit on women, and later, when we're married, to tune them out.\" - 14. East Coast: Flashback Jack Donaghy makes out with one of his three dancing ladies. West Coast: Flashback Jack is much more chaste, though still barechested. - 15. East Coast: Jon Hamm appears as his hook-handed character Drew Baird, narrating a commercial like so: \"Thanks to an idea that started as a pitch for a horror movie and then grew into a charitable organization, hands from executed criminals are now making life better for people all over the world.\" West Coast: It's been changed to: \"Thanks to groundbreaking research at the Yale University for hand frankensteining, hand transplants are a reality.\" - 16. East Coast: Drew shows off his transplanted hand, which is a little bit scary-looking and tries to choke him. West Coast: Now, Drew's new hand is from a lady: \"Donors are rare. As you can see, I've had to accept a female hand.\" The hand strokes his face and then goes towards his crotch. \"Oh God,\" he moans. \"Please take off your rings!\" - 17. East Coast: In the final scene, Liz is happy with how her birthday went. After all, she even \"got to eat the cake off the floor.\" West Coast: This time, she \"ate the Fonz's face.\" Still off the floor, presumably.",

This version has the following scenes reinstated: - A guardsman named Mr. Widdenfield (played by Arthur Malet) harasses Captain Greer, while Mrs. Hobday tries to clear things out (leading into the song \"The Old Home Guard\"). - A Home Guard sergeant asking for permission to dismiss the marching parade (immediately after \"The Old Home Guard\" ends). - Mr. Jelk tells Mrs. Hobday of his plans to buy Miss Price's house. - At dinner time, Carrie tells Miss Price she and her brothers are orphans, while she explains what happened to their caretaker, Aunt Bessie. - Miss Price notes mango-wurzel jam is available at the dinner table, and they say grace, as the children look disgusted at Miss Price's tastes in food. - Miss Price tells the children no one has ever seen her workroom before. - As Mr. Jelk brings a letter to Miss Price (the one that informs her the Emelius Browne Correspondence College of Witchcraft has closed), he tries to get into the house and talk to her, but she politely sends him away. - When Miss Price asks Paul for the bedknob back to get to London, Charlie attempts to extort some money from her, but she rebuffs him. - After \"The Age of Not Believing,\" Paul tries to get the bed to fly, but Miss Price forgot to tell him to tell the knob where to take them. - When the children find Mr. Browne on the streets of London, they take the bed with them and follow him. - The entire song \"With a Flair\" and its lead-in, as well as Mr. Browne's subsequent offer to sell his magic props. - When Miss Price says \"we'd be delighted [to join Mr. Browne for luncheon],\" Mr. Browne asks if the children belong to her. - At the townhouse where Mr. Browne is staying, Miss Price explains to her what substitutiary locomotion is and why she wants the spell. - The second nursery scene, in which Paul discovers the book \"Isle of Naboombu,\" is put before \"Eglantine\", whereas it was formerly after it. - The song \"Eglantine\" is restored to its entirety. - The song \"Portobello Road\" is restored to its entirety, as its subsequent dance sequence. The main song adds a scene with a used clothing merchant and another scene where Charlie and Paul play cricket. In the dance, the Caribbean dance now precedes the Irish dance. Unlike the rest of the formerly cut scenes, the tail end of the Irish dance and the beginning of the dance's climax only existed as a faded work-print that had to be digitally scanned and cleaned before it could be brought back to a passable state. - Mr. Browne tells Swinburne that the bed once belonged to royalty and is being offered to the Bookman as a present, while the children push the bed through the door. - Mr. Browne rebuffs the Bookman's offer to swap sections of the book, but relents when he is threatened. - A scene in the village store where Mrs. Hobday meets Mr. Browne and suggests he should marry Miss Price. Mr. Jelk walks in and overhears them. - The song \"Nobody's Problem's for Me\" is reinstated after Mr. Browne leaves the house. No orchestral track existed, so the studio recorded a new one.",

        "In 2007, 'Ridley Scott' (qv) released \"Blade Runner: The Final Cut\", digitally remastered with improved visual and sound effects, and with numerous revisions to the 1992 Director's Cut. The more noticeable differences between The Director's Cut and The Final Cut include: - The overall film has been brightened considerably, revealing previously hidden details in many shots. Additionally, the digital enhancement reveals many heretofore obscured details, such as dirty dishes in Deckard's apartment and a freeway high above Pris as she approaches the Bradbury. - The opening credits have been completely redone, although in the exact same font as in the original film. The noticeable shimmer effect from the theatrical cut and the Director's Cut has been removed. - In the opening shot, the flames shooting up have been re-animated to look more synchronized with the associated light play on the smokestacks. - In the shots of the staring eye, you can briefly see the pupil react to the setting of 2019 L.A. - A couple of shots were trimmed (such as Deckard's intro reading the newspaper). - Additional smoke was added behind the cook when Gaff ('Edward James Olmos' (qv)) and a police officer are talking to Deckard while he is eating at the White Dragon. - All spinner wires have been removed and matte lines erased. - Bryant's ('M. Emmet Walsh' (qv)) line \"I've got four skin jobs walking the streets\" has been improved so it's not obviously an inserted recording. - Bryant says that \"2\" replicants were fried in the electrical field (as opposed to the theatrical release and Director's Cut, where he says only 1 was killed). - Bryant describes Leon's job during the incept tapes scene. - New Cityspeak and other chatter comes over on the police scanner in Gaff's spinner rides both to the police station and the Tyrell building. - The original shot of Roy ('Rutger Hauer' (qv)) in the VidPhone booth that had been recycled from the later confrontation with Tyrell ('Joe Turkel' (qv)) has been digitally altered so that it truly does look like Roy was in the booth. The thumb on his shoulder has also been digitally removed from the shot. - The hotel manager mutters \"Kowalski\" as he opens the door to Leon's ('Brion James (I)' (qv)) room for Deckard and Gaff. - The new Unicorn footage is longer and shows Deckard to be awake during the sequence. This is how Ridley Scott and editor 'Terry Rawlings' (qv) originally conceived of the scene. Deckard is shown staring into space, and there is a cut to the unicorn. The film then cuts back to Deckard and again cuts back to the unicorn, before returning to Deckard once more. The shot of the unicorn which appeared in the Director's Cut has also been recolored, and the sound mix has been completely redone. - The blue grid lines on the Esper machine have been reanimated, to make them look less smooth. - When Deckard finds Zhora lying down in the back room on the photo, the image is now that of 'Joanna Cassidy' (qv); previously, it was clearly someone else. - New footage of the LA streets before Animoid Row and Taffy Lewis's club, including the hockey-masked geisha dancers. - The serial number on the snake scale now matches the Animoid Row lady's dialog. - There is a shot of Deckard asking for directions to Taffy Lewis' from a uniformed policeman. - The lip flap between Deckard and Abdul Ben Hassan has been digitally corrected (using 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv)'s son, Ben, as a stand-in for his mouth movements). - In Zhora's death scene, you can tell it is her the entire time; previously it was obvious that her stunt double, 'Lee Pulford' (qv), was in the shot. Joanna Cassidy's head was digitally superimposed over Pulford's. - Deckard's cut after retiring Zhora was digitally removed (it wasn't supposed to be there until after the fight with Leon). - The marquee inconsistencies on the Million Dollar Theatre have been corrected. - During Roy's confrontation with Tyrell, he says, \"I want more life, father\", as opposed to \"I want more life, fucker\". - When Roy kills Tyrell, the footage is the same as that found in the International Cut, with the additional violence. Additionally, when Roy turns to Sebastian, he says \"I'm sorry, Sebastian. Come. Come\", as he walks towards him. - When Pris ('Daryl Hannah' (qv)) attacks Deckard, she reaches down and grabs him by the nostrils - When Deckard shoots Pris, he shoots 3 times instead of 2. - The two shadows (of Ridley Scott and 'Jordan Cronenweth' (qv)) seen on the wall during the chase sequence have been removed. - When Roy pushes the nail through his hand, there is a shot of the nail coming through the skin on the other side. - When Roy releases the dove, it now flies up into a background that matches 2019 L.A. - The music which plays over the end credits is a newly composed piece by 'Vangelis' (qv); a different version of the 'End Credits' theme as heard in all other cuts. - In the closing credits, 'David L. Snyder' (qv) is now listed as 'David L. Snyder', instead of 'David Snyder'. Additionally, 'Ben Astar' (qv) is now credited for playing the role of Abdul Ben Hassan.",

This version has the following scenes reinstated: - A guardsman named Mr. Widdenfield (played by Arthur Malet) harasses Captain Greer, while Mrs. Hobday tries to clear things out (leading into the song \"The Old Home Guard\"). - A Home Guard sergeant asking for permission to dismiss the marching parade (immediately after \"The Old Home Guard\" ends). - Mr. Jelk tells Mrs. Hobday of his plans to buy Miss Price's house. - At dinner time, Carrie tells Miss Price she and her brothers are orphans, while she explains what happened to their caretaker, Aunt Bessie. - Miss Price notes mango-wurzel jam is available at the dinner table, and they say grace, as the children look disgusted at Miss Price's tastes in food. - Miss Price tells the children no one has ever seen her workroom before. - As Mr. Jelk brings a letter to Miss Price (the one that informs her the Emelius Browne Correspondence College of Witchcraft has closed), he tries to get into the house and talk to her, but she politely sends him away. - When Miss Price asks Paul for the bedknob back to get to London, Charlie attempts to extort some money from her, but she rebuffs him. - After \"The Age of Not Believing,\" Paul tries to get the bed to fly, but Miss Price forgot to tell him to tell the knob where to take them. - When the children find Mr. Browne on the streets of London, they take the bed with them and follow him. - The entire song \"With a Flair\" and its lead-in, as well as Mr. Browne's subsequent offer to sell his magic props. - When Miss Price says \"we'd be delighted [to join Mr. Browne for luncheon],\" Mr. Browne asks if the children belong to her. - At the townhouse where Mr. Browne is staying, Miss Price explains to her what substitutiary locomotion is and why she wants the spell. - The second nursery scene, in which Paul discovers the book \"Isle of Naboombu,\" is put before \"Eglantine\", whereas it was formerly after it. - The song \"Eglantine\" is restored to its entirety. - The song \"Portobello Road\" is restored to its entirety, as its subsequent dance sequence. The main song adds a scene with a used clothing merchant and another scene where Charlie and Paul play cricket. In the dance, the Caribbean dance now precedes the Irish dance. Unlike the rest of the formerly cut scenes, the tail end of the Irish dance and the beginning of the dance's climax only existed as a faded work-print that had to be digitally scanned and cleaned before it could be brought back to a passable state. - Mr. Browne tells Swinburne that the bed once belonged to royalty and is being offered to the Bookman as a present, while the children push the bed through the door. - Mr. Browne rebuffs the Bookman's offer to swap sections of the book, but relents when he is threatened. - A scene in the village store where Mrs. Hobday meets Mr. Browne and suggests he should marry Miss Price. Mr. Jelk walks in and overhears them. - The song \"Nobody's Problem's for Me\" is reinstated after Mr. Browne leaves the house. No orchestral track existed, so the studio recorded a new one.",

        "The unrated directors cut runs 112m 37s. The R-rated U.S. theatrical version runs 100m 13s, with numerous MPAA-imposed cuts for sexual content/dialogue and a couple New World Pictures-imposed ones for unknown reasons. - 16s of candid opening dialogue are trimmed in the R-rated version. After one of the group members tells Donny Hopper (Bruce Davison), \"Fuck you, Hopper,\" the following lines present in the unrated version are all removed -- Donny: \"I do. Every night. Me and my jar of Vaseline. I can fuck any woman I want and I don't even have to make her come.\" Female group member: \"Really? Well, I'd rather get fucked by a vibrator than your cock any day. It's honest, loving, and I don't have to make breakfast for it in the morning.\" The dirty Adam and Eve joke in Donny's monologue that survives in the R-rated version is pushed up further than it appears in the unrated version, while the main titles are slowed down. - In the scene where China Blue (Kathleen Turner) explains to Carl (John G. Scanlon) how she plays the flute and then gives him a blow job, the R-rated version shows it in one long take using alternate footage, with the camera never losing sight of his face as she goes down on him. The unrated version cuts away from him to show two close-up shots of her face next to his crotch, unzipping his bulging jeans and caressing the fly with her hand. These are bookended by an insert shot of an erotic, B&W line drawing, showing in triplicate, a Japanese woman giving a blow job to a Japanese man (who possesses one gargantuan erect penis and testicles). The unrated version of the scene runs 14s longer, because Turner says her lines more slowly. - The beginning of the China Blue/Carl aftermath scene uses alternate take footage in the R-rated version, up through the shot of China making a gargle and answering \"Miss Liberty.\" Carl's orgasm is over as he says \"fucking incredible\" once -- while in the unrated version, he's still having one as he says it twice -- and when he asks China her name, the camera again focuses on him in one long take. In the unrated version, shots of Carl alternate with four shots of China Blue bent down (with very smudged lipstick, as she wipes her mouth) and one shot of her hand turning off the radio. The R-rated version of this runs 14s longer again, mostly because both actors say their lines more slowly. - The scene where China Blue's second trick (Pat McNamara) rapes her has been truncated in the R-rated version. It cuts to Reverend Shayne standing outside after one sexual thrust, while the unrated cuts to it after sixteen more thrusts (intercut with five different erotic, color drawings of Japanese men and women engaged in you-know-what) and is 16s longer. - An additional 2 thrusts, totalling 2s, have been trimmed from the overhead shot of China Blue's second trick finishing the deed in the R-rated version. The unrated version has music over it, while U.S. theatrical prints have none. - In the unrated version, China Blue calls trick #2 \"sweetdick,\" a phrase which he then repeats. The R-rated version overdubs both utterances of the word with \"sweetheart.\" - When Reverend Shayne first gets in to see China Blue and tells her he's there to save her, she replies, \"Why don't you fuck me, that'll save me\" in the unrated version. The R-rated version overdubs the word \"fuck\" with \"fix.\" - China Blue goes on to tell Reverend Shayne that she's \"Fit as a fiddle and ready for cock\" in the unrated version. The R-rated version overdubs the word \"cock\" with \"love.\" - The R-rated version of the scene where Bobby Grady (John Laughlin) breaks into China Blue's apartment loses 21s of him turning on a wall-mounted TV and her VCR, which plays a porno tape of a man and woman having anal sex. - 50s are cut from the R-rated version after Bobby unzips the red panties in China Blue's drawer. The unrated version goes on to show him pulling out a book and opening it up to reveal the same kind of erotic Japanese drawings that were seen during China Blue's rape. Bobby turns the pages, stands up, and confusingly looks back and forth at the TV -- which now shows the man having a threesome with two women and cultimating in one of them -- and the book, before he has a revelation. Later in the film, when Bobby pays his first visit to Joanna's (Kathleen Turner) apartment, he comments on a similar, albeit somewhat less graphic, piece of artwork hanging on her wall, saying that he \"saw these a book once.\" This is left in the R-rated cut, so viewers who've only seen that version won't know where it was he saw it and what book he's talking about. - The R-rated version of the shot where China Blue undresses Bobby as they're about to first have sex has 7s trimmed of her unzipping his jeans and starting to remove them. - 1m 32s have been deleted from China Blue's and Bobby's first sex scene in the R-rated version -- 15s of them continuing to make out, the remaining 1m 17s of them doing the nasty in silhouette as he demonstrates all the new positions he just learned about in her book. - A 2m 37s scene of Bobby and Amy (Annie Potts) having a fight in front of Jimmy and Lisa (Seth Wagerman, Christina Lange) during breakfast was removed from the U.S. theatrical version by New World Pictures, possibly because Amy is extremely unpleasant in it. Bobby gets annoyed at her for pouring maple syrup, which he doesn't like, on his pancakes, she gets annoyed at him for noticing a week after the fact that she got her hair done, and she needles him by insinuating to the kids that he's stupid and useless because he can't plant a garden and doesn't know what strontium 90 means. He finally has enough of her cutting him down, and leaves for work in a huff. This scene appears in the film after the one where Reverend Shayne knocks Bobby down and Bobby and China Blue make amends. - New World Pictures broke the Grady family barbecue into two scenes in the U.S. theatrical cut. In that version, they bookend the scenes of China Blue being picked up by Arthur and Claudia (John Rose, Louise Sorel) in a limo and Reverend Shayne stabbing the blow-up doll. In the directors cut, the barbecue appears in its entirety immediately after that scene. - The unrated version contains a 3m 38s sequence of China Blue putting on her wig and makeup, picking up a handsome, corrupt cop (Randall Brady) on the streets, taking him back to her place, handcuffing him to her bed while wearing a leather S&M getup, having rough sex with him -- which causes his wrists to get cut up by the cuffs and his legs to get cut up by her high heels -- and grinding his nightstick into his stomach before sodomizing him with it, as Reverend Shayne watches the entire thing from behind his peephole, stroking his missile vibrator up and down. All of this is intercut with one erotic B&W Japanese line drawing -- similar to the one shown during Carl's blow job -- and three blood red-tinted photographs showing policemen in the line of duty. Afterwards, Reverend Shayne lies down and goes to sleep, and she uncuffs the cop and asks if he'd like to take a shower there, as she's got Ivory soap which is 99 44/100% pure (repeating what Bobby said after their first time), but he just spits on her in disgust, and she washes her face off in the sink (echoing what Bobby did after their first time), crying, after he's left. The MPAA refused to give the film an \"R\" unless this entire scene was removed. However, the shot which follows this -- of China Blue putting on her makeup in the mirror, still crying -- remains in the R-rated version, making it unclear exactly what she's upset about. - New World Pictures removed 2m 17s from the scene where Amy goes down to Grady's electronics store to try to rekindle with Bobby, again presumably because Amy is extremely unsympathetic. The theatrical cut of it ends when she tells him, \"All I want is my husband.\" The director's cut continues with her saying that the kids need a father to teach them responsibility, and him telling her he doubts it'll do them any good with the two of them playing a charade in front of them. He lets her know he doesn't want to get back together, and she correctly figures out that he's met someone else, as she can \"smell her all over\" him. She then returns to her old ways, and starts nagging him about the other woman. After he admits in stride that he's having an affair, she warns him to remember his family and make a choice.",

Some of the missing scenes are: - A couple of scenes at the college where Jeffrey attends which takes place during a dance where two of his friends are on the dance floor with him watching when another friend tells him he has a call from home and he learns about his father's stroke and tells his roommate he has to leave immediately. - The hospital scene is longer with more dialogue with Jeffrey trying to communicate with his incapiated father in his hospital bed and talking to a doctor who explains his father's condition. - A scene as Jeffrey's home with the doctor giving Mrs. Beaumont an injection to calm her down over the stress of her husband's plight. - Jeffrey having coffee with Mrs. Williams as he's waiting to talk to Detective Williams about his find of the severed human ear. Jeffrey also meets Sandy for the first time at the house. - An extended scene of Jeffrey with Dorothy in her apartment after Frank Booth leaves and finding another severed human ear in the bathroom sink. - An argument between Jeffrey and Sandy over his continued obsession in the Dorothy Valens case. - A rooftop scene during Jeffrey's second visit to Dorothy where she confides in him about her messed up life and wants to throw herself off the roof of the building. But Jeffrey stops her and they kiss for the first time. - A dinner scene where Jeffrey has dinner with Sandy and her parents where her boyfriend Mike joins them and grows suspicious at the table of the relationship between Sandy and Jeffrey. - A very surreal scene at the seedy nightclub \"This Is It\" where Frank and his three henchmen take Jeffrey and Dorothy through the dark, dimly lit place filled with topless waitresses, one of the lights her nipples on fire. Frank then beats up a man and throws him across a pool table for not fixing his jacket pockets for he \"lost his trophy.\" This explains how Jeffrey found the missing ear in the field behind the hospital, it apparently fell through a hole in Frank's jacket pocket. - A final epiloge scene at the police station where Jeffrey and Sandy give their statements to the press of the case and of Williams explaining that they found Dorothy's young son at the nightclub, Frank's henchmen are dead after the shootout at the warehouse, and the nightclub owner Ben and a few others have been aprehended at the club during the raid.",
