The only line heard is: 'The director's profession is very peculiar...'; whereas the European cut of the movie contains a longer narration, also starting with the same line, but expanding until the last image before fading to credits. The voice-over talks about how the director's profession is to find images, only to discover another image beneath the previous one which is more faithful to the truth, and then another, and another, until you reach the one which equals reality, the one no one will ever see. Both versions are equally powerful in their own right, though it's interesting to note such a minor difference was made in the first place.

Wolenski discuss what should be done with Germany after the war. - 4. The most famous missing scene occurs right after the nuns ask Hessler for aid in Ambleve. It has a young French boy attempt to assassinate Hessler. Hessler allows the boy to live, but has his father shot instead.

        "In December, 2003, the \"ALIEN QUADRILOGY\" box set was released with a newly created cut of \"Alien 3\" entitled 'the assembly cut.' It attempts to reconstruct David Fincher's workprint (which the studio balked at), but goes one step further and adds color correction, additional special effects and remixed 5.1 sound. Several scenes, however, suffer from poor on-set audio quality, mostly due to the use of fog machines and steam which obscures on-set dialog. Due to time and budget constraints, there was no time to re-record the dialogue for these scenes; optional subtitles transcript the dialog. It should be noted that the October 2010 \"ALIEN ANTHOLOGY\" Bluray boxset features the same 'assembly cut' as the 2003 DVD set. However, this time additional dialogue has been recorded, creating a soundtrack of more consistent quality, and making the addition of the deleted scenes all but seamless. Here are all of the found changes in the 'assembly cut': The scene of Ripley being rescued at the beginning is completely different. She is seen by Clements (Charles Dance) lying wahsed up on the beach and then taken into the prison, covered in dirt. A group of prisoners heads down to the beach with Oxen to get the EEV out of the water. In the theatrical print Ripley is discovered still inside her cryogenic unit inside the escape pod. This scene was re-shot to have footage of the dog (more on that later), and has no Oxen or scenes mentioned above. Various shots of people examining the escape pod that were in the theatrical print (as stated, they were taken from re-shoots made during post-production), including a shot of a facehugger crawling towards the dog and an elaborate optical shot of the EEV being carried out of the water by a crane (in the assembly cut it crashed right next to the shore), are missing from the DVD workprint. Immediately following the rescue sequence, 85 tells everyone in the mess hall to settle down, and Dillon preaches before Andrews' first 'rumor control.' The theatrical version started the scene directly with Andrews' rumor control. Just before the autopsy of Newt, there is a scene with Clemens, Ripley, and Prisoner Kevin walking down the spiral stairs into the morgue where Clemens questions Ripley about her need to certain Newt's death and also asks her if Newt was her daughter. Ripley denies this. As stated above, the alien comes out of an ox instead of a dog. There is a scene where two inmates are dragging an ox named babe after it has suddenly dropped dead into the butchery. They discuss what caused Babe's death, and they have some macho talk about Ripley. The scene ends when one of the inmates discovers a strange dead animal next to the ox's corpse (which is a dead Super facehugger). This scene replaces the scene in the theatrical cut where Murphy finds his wounded dog. The funeral scene is now intercut with scenes of the infant Alien bursting from the dead ox (originally it came out of the dog), concluding with a newly made digital shot of the Alien making its first steps and running off. Just before Ripley enters the mess Hall with her newly shaved head after the funeral, Prisoners Boggs and Rains share their complaints to Dillon about Prisoner Golic. They say he is crazy and smells bad, and that they don't want to work with him in the tunnels. Dillon tells them Golic is their brother and they should stop complaining. The scene in which Ripley and Dillon talk about temptations in the cafeteria ends on a shot of Dillon, where it originally ended on Ripley. Following Murphy's death, there is more dialog between Ripley and Clemens about why they had to cremate the bodies. Right after the scene where Ripley asks Clemens where the Bishop droid is, there is a scene where Dillon sees Boggs, Rains, and Golic, off on their excursion into the tunnels. Dillon asks them to light a candle for the dead prisoner Murphy (the first victim in the vent shaft). They go off into the tunnel. Immediately following this is the scene where Warden Andrews and Clemens meet to discuss Ripley. It has a completely new beginning, where the theatrical version begins with Andrews threatening Clemens, and ends with Andrews telling Clemens to \"sit the hell down.\" There is additional dialog here where Clemens explains to Andrews that Ripley was part of a combat team; Andrews eventually just tells Clemens to get out. Golic kicks open an old cigarette machine in the tunnel to get free cigarette packs. During Ripley's conversation with the reconnected Bishop, there are intercut scenes of a crazed and bloody Golic being found in the mess hall by Eric, the cook, who panics and drops the dishes. A little bit later, Golic is grabbed by the others (Clemens, 85, Andrews, and Dillon) and dragged to the infirmary. The scene following Andrews' talk with Ripley about the alien (where Ripley and Clemens talk) has a new opening shot in which the camera begins with a medium shot of Golic, then tracks through the hospital room. Later on in the scene, a tied up Golic interrupts with a few lines about how in an insane world, an sane man must appear to be insane; Clemens sarcastically thanks him. Golic spies on Ripley and Clemens talking by looking under the curtain. The alien drops from the air vent into the infirmary and lands on the mattress next to him causing it to 'lower'. There are more shots of it approaching, and Ripley sees it's feet through the bottom of the curtains. There is also a shot of the alien opening its mouth before killing Clemens. After the alien kills Clemens, and Ripley runs out of the infirmary, there is a close-up of Golic admiring the alien, he calls it \"magnificent.\" Followed by a shot of a large amount of blood dripping from the grate through which Clemens was hauled by the Alien (just after Ripley takes off for the dining hall). In the mess hall, Dillon leads a prayer and then chastises the prisoners for what has been going on (such as the attempted rape and the death of Murphy, Boggs, and Rains) as Ripley runs down the hallway. Andrews takes over with a sarcastic \"Thank you\" and the scene goes on as originally shown. A new shot where the prisoner mopping up Andrews' blood. He looks up at the air vent (an overhead shot). This is immediately followed by a new scene where Dillon preaches to the prisoners after Andrews' death. In the same scene after Morse says they should take Ripley's head and \"bash it through the fucking wall,\" Ripley replies \"That sounds good to me...\" There are several extra shots in the scene where the inmates set the trap in the tunnel (almost a minute's worth), including one with two inmates checking a pile of batteries, to see if there are some with enough electricity for Aaron's flashlight to work. Ripley looks exhausted while on paintbrush detail and shrugs it off, Dillon shows concern. As the explosions in the corridors are going off, there are several new shots of prisoners in the air vents engulfed in the flames and falling out of the vents on fire, as well as 85 running away from a burning prisoner. Dillon tries to activate the sprinkler to no effect (the sprinkler goes off in the theatrical version, and the scene ends right there). One of the prisoners is hurt badly and Ripley is trying to help him. The prisoner's friend Junior (the guy with the tear tattoo who initially attacks Ripley in the attempted rape scene) looks fearfully at her as she realizes both of them attacked her. The group runs for the spare sprinkler activator. The alien crawls down from the ceiling as the others (including Ripley and Dillon) try to lure it away. Junior is near the Toxic Waste room and sees a chance to trap the alien and runs into the room, causing the alien to run in after him and sacrificing his life. Ripley and Dillon lock the doors and the sounds of the alien killing him are heard outside. Dillon turns on the sprinklers. After finally putting out the fires, there are several new shots in the montage of prisoners walking through the wreckage of the hallways, and a scene where Dillon is leading a prayer for those who sacrificed themselves and died. Ripley and 85 look in from above and begin to discuss religion. 85 says that the company will arrive to kill the trapped alien with smart guns. Ripley asks him what to do if they won't kill it. Immediately following this, there is a scene where Morse is guarding the still bound Golic in the infirmary. Golic asks Morse to untie him, since his involvement in the killing of Boggs and Rains is no longer an issue. Morse reluctantly unties him, and after Golic asks him, tells him where the alien is trapped. Golic knocks him out and hurries out of the room. Next, there is a scene where 85 and Ripley are sending a transmission to the company about the trapped alien and Ripley, testing the company's intentions, requests permission to terminate the alien. The company quickly replies they are not to do anything against the alien, confirming Ripley's suspicions. Golic then arrives at the Toxic waste dump and tells the prisoner guarding the door he must talk to the creature. The prisoner shrugs him off and suddenly Golic slits his throat and opens the door, telling the alien he'll do anything he wants. Golic's screams as the alien attacks and runs away. Ripley then tells Dillon about the company's plans to keep the alien alive, which might jeopardize the entire universe. Dillon says he doesn't care about the rest of the universe. Ripley insists that innocent people will die and Dillon tells him that the world outside does not exist for them. Morse rushes in and tells them he has bad news. The three of them, along with 85 go to the dump where 85 blames Morse for the insane Golic's actions. Some of the latter scene was re-edited to make it follow the explosion sequence in the theatrical cut. A new scene in the assembly hall, after Ripley discovers she carries an Alien: the prisoners are arguing about the course of action to be taken; now that the Alien is free again, there is nothing stopping it from attacking them anywhere in the complex. One of the prisoners lights a match for his cigarette, which reminds all others of the Alien's fear of fire. They all decide to move to the furnace area immediately (which explains why Dillon's following 'peptalk' takes place there). When Ripley and 85 argue about contacting the company there is some extra dialog at the end of the scene. There is some added dialog in the scene where Ripley tells Dillon about the Queen inside of her, mainly about the nature of the Queen and the consequences of its survival. Also, when Ripley fights with Dillon after he refuses to kill her, there is an added line where Dillon says \"Go kill yourself\". During the scene where the remaining prisoners are meeting to discuss Dillon and Ripley's plan to terminate the alien, there are expanded dialog scenes concerning Dillon telling them they have a choice to get even with the creature for its destroying the others. Ripley then questions 85's statements that the rescue team is on its way. Some of the prisoners discuss religion before the tunnel sequence (right after Dillon says they are \"Praying\"). They laugh hysterically, which freaks out David (Pete Postlethwate). This replaces a scene where David is told by another prisoner named Jones what he's supposed to do. Jones leaves and David says to himself, \"This was her idea.\" Following this, there is a shot cut OUT of the assembly cut of 85 waiting for the rescue team. David (Pete Postlethwaite) finds Vincent's body in the tunnel. As the alien rampages through the tunnel, Ripley asks what the prisoners are doing (when two of them guarding the piston run off) and Dillon says \"Improvising\". There is more dialog when Bishop II confronts Ripley as he refers to the malignancy inside her and the great courage she has shown. There is also an added scene where the Asian medic explains the procedure to remove the alien from Ripley. When Bishop II asks Ripley to trust him and she must choose, the scene is more drawn out, and you can see Ripley agonizing more over the decision she must make. When 85 hits Bishop II with the pipe there is an additional moment which Bishop II can be seen in pain and wiping red blood from his face (adding more weight to the statement that he is indeed human and not an android. He shouts \"I'm not a droid!\" After this, Bishop sees one of his crew-members with a camera trying to film Ripley, and he tells the man with the camera, \"No pictures!\" Several shots of Ripley preparing for her jump, as she looks hesitant and nervous. She looks at Bishop and says \"You're crazy\" right before she jumps. Ripley's death scene is a completely alternate take: In the theatrical version, as Ripley falls, the alien queen burst out of her chest, here she simply falls into the lead. Her body can be seen burning up just before it hits the lead.",

He simply peers into the tunnel. - A few more scenes of 85 and Ripley arguing about what the company will do with the alien. - Shots of Dillon walking through corridors and finding bodies (Troy) as well as Ripley finding bodies (Eric) and verbally identifying them. - Jude slips, falls and cuts himself with the scissors he was holding. - 85 silently meditating with his head bowed down as he awaits the company people. - When the company reps arrive, it is extended as the Asian rep asks 85 if he's seen the beast, and 85 says yes and that Ripley has one inside her. Bishop II replies, \"We know that.\" When 85 sees the cage he tells them \"Your gonna need a bigger cage.\" - When Ripley is trying to lure the alien back into the piston, she keeps telling it to kill her. - Right before activating the sprinklers and killing the alien, Ripley says \"For the last time...\" (this shot is in several of the film's trailers) - When Ripley tells Morse to help her and he asks \"What do you want me to do?\" She replies, \"You'll know...\" - After Ripley falls, Morse crawls over to look out into the molten pit. - The last scenes are arranged a little differently with the video screen facility closed shot coming before the shot of the empty cryotubes and Ripley's transmission being heard.",

(Stuart's mom shows up, asking \"Would you boys like some lemonade?\", to which Stuart's dad rants about how \"We don't even have goddamn kitchen!\"). Also featured a warning about how huffing natural gas was bad, not to mention that fire was horrendously dangerous, again, if you weren't animated. - Episode \"Incognito\" fell out of syndication after only a few airings.

        "Following attacks from politicians on violent films aimed at children, Warner Brothers. pushed the release date back and recut the film to a tamer version, toning down some of the violence in the original cut sent out in screener tapes. On April 23, 2001, the unedited version of the film was released in the US exclusively on DVD. Up until that point the uncut version had only been released as screeners that were sent out before the changes were made. The following are scenes that were changed in the edited-for-content version: - Lots of white flashes have been added to the action sequences where there were previously none. Additionally, combinations of punches have been mostly trimmed down to one punch. For example, Woof slashes the guard once now instead of twice. Batman no longer punches Ghoul in the gut, he just uppercuts him into the dish. Later on in the club, Terry's vicious attack on Ghoul is cut to a flash and Terry running away while Ghoul falls. There is a 360-degree fight sequence in the opening battle that has also been removed, where Batman fends off the Jokerz one by one. - Seat belts added to Terry and Bruce as the drive home after their first meeting with the new Joker. - Bonk is not shot, but given a lethal dose of laughing gas, and he dies off screen. Because of this the whole \"Take the trash outside, Dee Dee\" and \"Are you with me?\" sequence is cut. - When Bruce throws the batarang it appears as though he's pleased he can still throw & catch a batarang instead of it showing him using it to decapitate a Two Face dummy. - When Terry enters the Batcave to find it demolished by the Joker, the letter's 'HA! HA!' written across the floor are changed from red to purple. Probably to assure us it is not written on Bruce's blood. - All other blood is removed. (Only one example was passed over. In the flashback sequence when Batman smashes through the projection he smacks the Joker. Blots of blood fly from the Jokers mouth, but he is not bleeding in the next shot.) - In the unedited version, when Batman (in the present) frees himself from the Jokers' ribbon wrap, he throws the knife that he used to free himself with at the Joker. The Joker ducks at the last second and the blade goes through the stage curtain. This would explain the hole behind the Joker. - The Joker is not shot, but slips in some water and is electrocuted off screen. Plus, they don't mention they buried him deep under Arkham or any of that. The dialogue is completely changed in that sequence. - Barbara says that Leslie Thompkins helped Tim Drake \"regain himself\" instead of \"regain his sanity.\" (or something along those lines) - During a montage where Batman and Batgirl comb \"the underworld\" looking for clues about Robin's disappearance, Batgirl talks to a nicely-dressed man and woman instead of two sleazily-dressed women (who are pretty obviously hookers) on a street corner. - Also, Joker no longer slices Batman across the chest of in the leg, and any blood is digitally removed. Joker just punches Batman. - More than half of the \"Our Family Memories\" is cut out, only showing Robin tied up and struggling, and cutting the scene where Joker opens the barbeque lids, picks up the voltage tongs, and shocks the Boy. - A lot of dialogue is changed as well. And reference to the word \"kill\" is changed. - The opening fight seqeunce is trimmed, cutting out a second Dee-Dee kick and completely redoing that entire Batman/Dee Dee sequence. - The club fight is changed. The pink clown no longer punches Terry and says \"I don't know why the boss wants a dreg like you outta the way, but as long as it's fun...\". He just goes for his gun and says \"Slag him!\". - Bruce says \"Robin defeated him.\" instead of \"Robin did kill him\". Joker says \"Bat-Kook\" instead of \"Bat-Fart\". Jordan Price says \"Ice\" instead of \"kill\". Tim Drake says \"I can still hear his scream\" instead of \"I can still hear the shot\". Joker says \"...with such yutzes\" instead of \"...with such putzes\". - In the scene where the satellite laser chases the Batmoblie it blasts an unmarked, dark, seemingly empty building. Originally it was a lit movie theater. (In the edited version the word 'cineplex' can be seen exploding out of the wreckage in the last few frames of the shot.) - The clothing on 'Nanna Harley' is changed from blue and purple to Harley Quinn's trademark red and black.",

A shot of a cutting torch being picked up just after the main logo is missing. Two Face's reply after the guard says \"You said you'd let me live\" is missing. After the 'punctual funeral' line, Two Face shouting \"Kill the Bat!\" has been removed from the soundtrack and replaced with music and guards grunting. When the elevator dings just before Batman exits, Two Face's shout of \"Blast him!\" was not present in the UK version. The fight outside the elevator has lost a lot of sound effects, as well as a sequence where Batman drops his leg sharply onto a thug's chest, complete with a loud thud. Batman delivering a backward head butt and breaking a thug's nose in extreme close-up has been removed. Close-ups of kicks to midriffs and faces are also missing. Two Face's lines in the helicopter about the acid have been removed. In the sequence where the helicopter pilot is killed, Two Face emptying an entire clip into the helicopter pilot has been trimmed, along with shots showing the bullets riddling the pilot's body from the front. The cut UK version had only three shots fired, and the pilot is shown slumping from behind. The death of Stickley does not show him stopping on the window ledge, and hanging in terror, before Nygma runs over and says \"Fred, babe! You are fired! Or should I say...terminated?\". With this, he pulls the hat off him and he falls down, but this was all cut from the UK print. Two Face's line in the circus big top was cut from the UK version, \"Our new act for your personal amazement: we call it - Massacre Under The Big Top!\". A shot of Nygma laughing at the above line is also missing. When the Mayor asks what Two Face wants at the circus, his reply is shortened from \"Batman - bruised, broken, bleeding. In a word, dead!\" to simply \"Batman\". The UK version is missing the sequence where Bruce Wayne kills one guard on the right side of the big drum by coming up behind him, breaking his neck, and smacking him in the face as he falls. When Two Face flips his coin before killing the Graysons, after his evil laugh he goes on to say \"Their kind of day\", which was missing in the UK version. As the bomb is raised through the roof of the circus, a quick sequence of Bruce flipping a guard over and kicking him hard in the gut is missing. When Two Face accidentally kills two of his men in the car, their screams have been cut short in the UK version, and a shot of the driver's terrified face has been removed. The fight at Nygma's party loses some impact sounds. Shortly after this, Batman makes a guard do the splits and another crack accompanies this, but the sound has virtually been eliminated from the soundtrack. A small crack has been greatly reduced in volume as Batman twists a thug's arm backwards Robin throwing Two Face a vicious head butts after the line, \"This is for me!\" has been replaced in the UK version, by removing the punch Robin throws after he says \"This is for my brother\" and reinserting in place of the head butt.",

In the original cut, there is an opening narration by Captain Kirk stating: \"Enterprise Log: Captain James Kirk commanding. We are leaving that vast cloud of stars and planets which we call our galaxy. Behind us: Earth, Mars, Venus, even our sun are specks of dust. A question: what is out there in the black void beyond? Until now our mission has been that of space law regulation, contact with Earth colonies and investigation of alien life. But now, a new task; a probe out into where no man has gone before.\" followed by the words \"STAR TREK\" appearing on screen. They fade away and are replaced by \"STARRING WILLIAM SHATNER.\" The episode then moves into act one, with the words \"STAR TREK ACT I\" appearing on screen. The episode then proceeds as normal until Scotty says \"It's begun transmitting, sir.\" at which point, the words \"TONIGHT'S EPISODE 'WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE'\" appear. After which, there is an extended pan of the Enterprise hallways with the titles \"CO-STARRING LENOARD NIMOY AS MR. SPOCK\" appearing and fading away, followed by \"GUEST STARS GARY LOCKWOOD AND SALLY KELLERMAN.\" Over this scene, the red alert klaxon blares and Lieutenant Kelso repeatedly saying \"Bridge to all decks. Condition: alert!\" We also see Gary Mitchell walking around the corridors as well until finally cutting to Kirk and Spock entering the turbolift, at which point the episode continues as normal. Additionally, the end credits were much different in this original cut. Instead of the normal \"Star Trek\" theme playing, a different piece is used and the credits only credit the supporting characters; none of whom are referenced by name. (For example: PAUL FIX AS: SHIP'S DOCTOR, GEORGE TAKEI AS: CHIEF PHYSICIST, JAMES DOOHAN AS: ENGINEERING CHIEF, etc.)",

Instead, the last we see of him is when he's lying on his back in the burning room and we hear the words of his daughter \"everybody dies\". The camera zooms in on the numbers on the outside door, just as they melt from the heat. The next scene is at Mike's funeral where his coffin is lowered into the ground right next to his daughter's; just as the visions 1408 prophesied. Lily is there, being consoled by Mike's agent. As the procession ends, Lily walks to her car and is met by Gerald Olin who is carrying a box. Gerald introduces himself and gives his condolences. He says the box contains some of Mike's belongings still left in the room. He offers it to Lily while also trying to explain, with a sense of hope, that Mike's death of was not in vain and that because of his actions no one else will *ever be able to stay in room 1408. Lily, in too much grief to listen, cuts him off and refuses to accept the box. Gerald returns to his car and opens the box, which contains the nightgown that was sent through the fax machine as well and the burned tape recorder. Gerald plays it and hears the same dialog between Mike and his daughter heard at the end of the theatrical release. As he listens, he sees a young girl in his rear-view mirror waving in his direction. He turns around to look at her and catches a brief vision of Mike Enslin in his back seat, hideously burned. Gerald jumps but the vision quickly disappears. He looks back at the girl who has found her dad that was looking for her. Gerald catches his breath, starting his car and driving off. The final scene goes back to room 1408. We see a specter Mike Enslin staring out the window. The last shot is of him finishing his cigarette and walking towards the door just as he vanishes.",

        "Originally conceived as \"Stripped and Strapped\" written by Warhol luminary Chuck Wein and Genevieve Charbin, was intended to capture the counter-culture scene of mid-late 1960s Manhattan. Although the script was never finished some of the original material from the script by Wein and Charbin was shot but ultimately cut from Ciao! Manhattan. These scenes are now featured on the DVD 30th Anniversary edition as \"The Lost Reels\" and include: - Missing Subplot: In \"Stripped and Strapped,\" Susan, played by Edie Sedgwick, had a friend played by Nena Thurman (mother of actress Uma Thurman) who was involved in an incestuous relationship with her brother. Scenes of them together are show in a kitchen. - Another part of the missing subplot included Susan's obsession with astrological signs and things of an other worldy nature. In the Lost Reels, scenes are shown of Susan (Edie) in a room painted wall to floor with strange astrology and hand signs, talking with Allen Ginsberg. These scenes like the incestuous brother and sister were written by Chuck Wein who was inspired by Andy Warhol, who did films about nothing, and so Wein wrote these scenes to be about nothing. - Additional unfinished footage: - Scenes of Susan (Edie) at the \"Be-In\" were originally longer and featured her climbing a rock and socializing with the hippie crowd. - Aerial shots of Manhattan, which in 1967 looked industrial and more concrete, taken in a helicopter rented from the Pan-Am building of the time. - Scenes of Nena Thurman and Susan(Edie) shop-lifting at downtown Manhattan store Paraphernalia. - Scenes of Susan(Edie) having a \"bitch fight\" with Baby Jane Holzer after Susan returns home to the Chelsea Hotel from shop-lifting at Paraphernalia. - Susan and Paul America eating sushi at one of the first sushi bars in late 60s Manhattan. - More scenes of Edie and Paul America wandering New York. Also included are some night shots of Edie at a fountain. - David Weisman was also featured in the film much longer before editing and included: Scenes of him at his home with Nena Thurman, Edie, Paul America and some friends of his getting high. David shows off his Samuri sword, apparently he had an obsession with Kurosawa films. Also a scene of David with his Manhattan \"Scenesters\" is shown. - Three dancers are shown dancing in front of Mario with a monkey. - Allen Ginsberg's appearance at the \"Medium Convention\" was origanlly much longer and featured him performing one of his monologues. - Some shots of Paul America in a car, picking up and dropping off Baby Jane Holzer at the heloport, he gets angry and takes off in the car and isn't seen again for a few years. - The only existing footage of the interior of famed Max's Kansas City was found among the reels and is featured here. - Some beautiful black and white footage of women in the cotumes/dresses of the Silver Sixties are shown at night in the cold fog. - Missing color footage included: A shot of Edie falling over while dancing in front of Butch, she spills the cup of vodka she is drinking on the mattress at the bottom of the pool.",

Bennett's death was also trimmed to remove focus on his suffering. The 2001 UK DVD release retained these cuts and also added a further 44 seconds of distributor cuts. This was because the DVD master used for the UK release was a censored German cut. All cuts were fully waived in 2007 by the BBFC.

In this version additional edits include: - In the opening scene, after Cooke ('Bill Duke (I)' (qv)) has initially shot the man in the robe, he walks over to the body and shoots him again. This second hit has been removed. - When Matrix breaks Henriques' ('Charles Meshack' (qv)) neck on the plane, he simply elbows him, and in the next shot, Henrqiues is already dead. The shot of Matrix snapping Henriques neck is gone. - The shot of the piece of wood sticking through Cooke's stomach is absent. - All close ups of the pole in Bennett's ('Vernon Wells (I)' (qv)) stomach are gone.",

After Annie goes upstairs, she overhears Pete talking on the phone telling his wife how he missed her and describes Annie as unattractive. Shocked by that, she went back downstairs and saw Taylor taking some contraceptive pills before leaving the house hastily. - The home video of Megan (Melissa McCarthy) and Jon (Ben Falcone) is slightly longer.

Wat and Roland say there should be three phoenixes, since there's three of them. - Lord Adhemar's original introduction scene, where he slaps around one of his servants while having his armor fitted, and reference is made to the \"triple phoenix\" design of Sir Ulrich's crest. - Chaucer giving another substantial introduction for Sir Ulrich, similar to the first one, right before his match with Lord Adhemar. He berates Adhemar's herald before the speech; after the speech, Adhemar's herald appears impressed, which leads to his imitation of Chaucer's style later in the film. - When Adhemar leaves the dance, we find out the reason for his pained expression; in a deleted scene, he reveals to a monk that he is tone-deaf, and has never been able to hear music as anything more than noise. Adhemar then strides out into the midst of the poor, waiting outside the castle for handouts, and starts a riot by throwing food and money into the crowd. - Another deleted scene has Will, Roland, Wat, and Kate seeing Chaucer walking back to their quarters naked again. They follow him, but it turns that he was fetching food for his wife, Phillipa (who is also naked), and had not lost his clothes gambling like they thought. They leave, laughing, and run into Jocelyn and Christiana. Christiana and Roland leave together (with a suggestion of romance), William and Jocelyn leave together, but when Wat holds out his hand for Kate, she just hands him a pastry and walks off. Wat says \"Hey, Beautiful\" to the pastry and walks off happy anyway. - The original version of the scene with William in the stocks is considerably longer, and has an extensive speech by Chaucer (which is probably his best in the film). Rather than having the crowd calmed by the appearance of Prince Edward, the crowd is converted by Chaucer's speech, and has already begun chanting \"William, William!\" by the time the Prince reveals himself. A much stronger version of the scene, but cut down in favor of having the Prince's role expanded.",

Grace informs Norm and Jake about it. - The squad reaches the abandoned school. It reveals that Grace teaches English to the Na'vi children until a serious incident came about (bullet holes around, etc..) which was insinuated about. - Jake and Neytiri tripping through the neon-light woods is slightly longer. - When Jake joins the circle, a little Na'vi girl smiles at him curiously, but her father holds her back. Neytiri then arrives and hands Jake a fruit. - Jake tries to ask Neytiri her name, but she seems annoyed by that. - Jake, Grace and Norm proceed from the helicopter to the secluded laboratory. There's an explanation about the mountains. - At night, Jake and Neytiri run through the luminescent forest. - After Jake touches the Fan Lizard, it flies away in a radiant glow. Its fellow species follow suit and, to the delight of Jake and Neytiri, raise themselves into the air. - As Jake and the other Na'vi climb the mountain, Neytiri flies past them on a Seze. - The Na'vi goes for an aerial hunt for Stuurmbeast. Jake shoots one and exclaims in excitement. Neytiri follow suit as well. - The Na'vi destroy the Hell Trucks of the mining company. - The next morning, Wainfleet's squad sifts through the remains of the Hell Trucks. Turns out that Na'vi kill the soldiers as well. Quaritch and Selfridge watch the live broadcast. - Tsu'tey's fall from the sky is longer. A few plants decelerate and break his fall. - The Hammerhead Titanotheres has been extended. - The fight between Neytiri on a Thanathor and Quaritch is slightly longer. - Tsu'Tey's death: he knows he is dying and appoints Jake to be his successor. He insists Jake to kill him because by Na'vi customs, Jake has to pass him to the Eywa by killing him by his own hands. Neytiri starts to cry. Jake reluctantly complies with his wish, stabbing him by the knife as the camera passes by him. - The end credits has an addition of using Discovery Zone's Bless the Plague soundtrack.

This version also ADDED one scene to the film that was not in the original 165 minute release, in which Harmonica gets up with a wounded arm after being shot in the opening scene. When it was run on U.S. network television, A.B.C. made edits to the 165 minute international version. Paramount's syndicated television version was also the international version (with edits).

Then they reused the scene of Serena walking down the hall (the stain on her dress is back), to fill the extra time. Suddenly, when they get to the front of the embassy, Serena is holding a pink parasol. You can see part of the cut scene in \"Day of Destiny\" when Serena is trying to get Darien to remember her. After the princess unveils the diamond, Serena says she needs a few minutes to herself. She has an empty cocktail glass in her hand and she's blushing. In the original, she decides to drink one of the cocktails, which she thinks it's juice and becomes slightly drunk. In the English version, the kiss at the end is supposed to be a dream. In the Japanese version, the kiss actually happens.",

The film sat on a shelf for almost 25 years until actress Lea Lander rescued it from oblivion by helping finance a DVD release: a new short prologue was shot, according to Bava's original script, and editing and scoring were completed using existing available materials.  In 2002 producer Alfredo Leone and director Lamberto Bava (Mario's son), allegedly dissatisfied with the DVD edit, produced a new restored version of the film.  Lamberto Bava and his son Roy shot additional footage and original composer Stelvio Cipriani created a new complete musical score (though the DVD release employed some of Cipriani's cues and themes, the film was never properly scored in 1974).  This restored version, produced by Kismet Entertainment Group and retitled \"Kidnapped\", premiered theatrically in the US on May 31, 2002 as part of a Mario Bava retrospective at the American Cinematheque's Egyptian Theater in Hollywood",

Other scenes have been severely truncated or re-shot: There is a scene with Feyd Harkonnen in a bath being pampered by three women. In this version the women are fully clothed. When Princess Corrino seduces Feyd Harkonnen for information, the scene fades out abruptly, implying that the Princess gave herself to Feyd for the information. In uncut version, after extracting the information, the Princess presents a topless Farrah as a gift to Feyd, and during the 'love scene' that ensues, the Princess slips away. Considering that the Princess' virginity is the prize offered to both the male heirs of the Atreides and Harkonnen clans, this clumsy cut significantly changes the story. There is a scene where the Fremen remove their desert camouflage and uniforms, revealing their nakedness to Paul Atreides. It is a symbolic scene, for Paul sees that under their uniforms, the Fremen are people, just like he and his mother.

        "In order to receive a PG-13 rating a number of scenes where deleted altogether from the final print. The missing scenes are: - All of the scenes involving a character called the Crying Drunk Girl (Jennifer Elise Cox) who is so drunk that she has subtitles for when she speaks and she is the key to what is going on in movie. Her missing scenes of dialogue are: - After Preston and Denise talk with the Yearbook Girl, the Crying Drunk Girl walks up to them and says, \"Thush bezt weveram sisu gizem chext ear.\" (subtitle translation: \"This is the best party ever! I'm gonna miss you guys next year!) She group hugs them and walks away where Preston says, \"There's one at every party.\" - After Preston walks away from the Exchange Student at the backyard pool, the Crying Drunk Girl walks over to the Exchange Student and says to him, \"Idlik tach yre enis!\" (I'd like to touch your penis!) - When Kenny and Denise suddenly get locked in the upstairs bathroom and scream \"NOOOOO!!!\" the tracking shot from the bathroom door leads down the steps directly to the Crying Drunk Girl who somehow hears them and she says \"Yerd dum shelling yers chairs.\" (Did anyone hear that? Somebody's yelling for help upstairs!) But since no one can understand her, no help comes to Kenny or Denise. - When Amanda is talking to the Stoned Guy and the Watermelon Guy about who Preston is, the Crying Drunk Girl stumbles over to Amanda, leans on her shoulder, and says: \"Snow stun shy is shy sumber shess sing.\" (I know who Preston Meyers is. I can give you his phone number, his address, anything.) Unable to understand her, Amanda just shrugs her off and walks away. - During the police raid, one of the cops is talking to the Crying Drunk Girl on the front lawn of the house who asks her to stop crying and speak clearly and she says, \"I allred tdya, mnwans is mray hunds, ive at seveithg nolfok. (But I already told you! My name is Mary Hampson and I live and 1781 Norfolk!) Unable to understand her, the cop puts in her in a police van with Kenny's two Homboys and others who include the Hippy Girl, the Headbanger and others. - Also deleted was the scene involving the Stoned Girl (Amber Benson) who is glimpsed holding a banana as William walks through the kitchen to taste his first beer. It takes place in between the scenes where Kenny hits on Ashley and Jana where he sees her leaning against a dining room shelf and talks to her, but all she says is \"Okay\" everything he says. Then another girl walks in and thanks Kenny for finding her and says that Stephanie (the name of the Stoned Girl) just took three thingies of herbal ecstasy is so out of it. The girlfriend helps the Stoned Girl to her feet and they leave, leaving Kenny alone and downbeat. - Also deleted was the original opening which takes place in a bookstore the day before the graduation where Preston is talking to Denise about his desire for Amanda and his plans for going away to college. - When Kenny and his two homeboys first arrive at the party, Kenny plays around with a large sheepdog, named Mr. Tuxford, at the front door who belongs to the Girl Whose Party It Is, who jumps onto Kenny licking his face where he pushes the dog away who runs out the front door and the Girl runs after him. - There is more dialogue after when Kenny and Denise are released from the upstairs bathroom where the Girl Whose Party It Is continues yelling at Kenny and about the destruction they brought to her house as they are walking down the stairs where the house is now completely deserted and ransacked, and then the Girl's dog runs into the house and she drops to one knee and hugs the dog while Kenny takes this distraction to walk out and follow Denise. - A scene where the Watermelon Guy holds up a large watermelon and says \"This was in my freezer since September and I've poured six bottles of vodka into it and I've been saving it for this time!\" When all the guys around him grab at it, the watermelon falls on the kitchen floor splattering. - A scene in the \"make-out room\" where Mike Dexter enters looking for Amanda in the basement lit with dim red light and he turns on the basement lights revealing a dozen or more scantly clad boys and girls necking and shirtless William is among them with one of the Groupies and another girl. William gets up, puts on a blue band shirt, turns the lights back off and follows Mike upstairs after saying he remembers what he was supposed to do tonight. - During the raid when the Yearbook Girl tries getting her yearbook floating on the swimming pool after William throws it in, she falls head first into the pool. She climbs out and runs into a group of kids running from the cops and falls back in the pool again. Then the Reminiscing Guy appears, pulls her out with of the pool as her savior with her yearbook and they make their getaway. - More scenes with William and the Stoned Guy who put marijuana in the mini dinosaur and inhales from the mouth and then gives it to William for a try. - As Preston is walking away from the trash cans after throwing away his letter to Amanda, he passes by a car where a girl's leg is sticking out of a window and the unmistakable sounds of lovemaking are heard from the car. - An extended scene with Kenny and his two Homeboys in the convenience store where they are talking while they are bringing their stuff to the cash register to purchase. - In the scene where the Hippy Girl is tasting a marijuana brownie with the Hippy Guy, she tells him that he's supposed to melt the weed in with the butter, not put it in the mix and then says: \"these brownies suck!\" and then throws it in the direction of Denise. - The final scene at the diner is expanded with a shot from the Yearbook Girl and the Reminiscing Guy looking at some romance between them, the shot moves to the next booths where they show the band of the bass player, drummer, guitarist and lead singer trying to make sense about the night before, to the Foreign Exchange Student and the Crying Drunk Girl having found each other and both talking in incoherent, nonsense language and understanding each other, to at least two other booths, including the Girl Whose Party it was, before stopping at the booth with Mike Dexter and his jock friends. - The final parts of 'where the characters are now' were changed. The original Kenny and Denise part originally read: Denise dumped Kenny later that day. Denise went to NYU, where she found a whole bunch of people just like her. Bored at it all, she dropped out and started shooting photo covers for Rolling Stone Magazine. She currently directed the latest music video for Wu-Tang Clan. - The original Kenny bit read: Kenny went to UCLA and found a bunch of people just like him. Unable to compete, he reinvented himself as an eco-conscious vegan nudist. He currently lives with a cult in Northern California. - Other character bios read: William's friends, Geoff Piccirilli and Murphy Pelan, did not go to college. They created a comic book called Citizen X about a man with no identity, no Social Security number, nothing, who uses his anonymity to infiltrate numerous conspiracies involving the government, aliens, and the abduction and subsequent probing of them and other innocent people by extraterrestrials. They are currently dating no one. - Another character quote reads: Amanda's cousin, Ron, is currently in prison. - The Girl Whose Party It Is was also featured and it reads: The Girl Whose Party It Was, Molly Stinson, dropped out of college her freshman year to work as an intern for her role model, Martha Stewart. Three months later, she was hospitalized for a nervous breakdown. She is currently working as a librarian. - The Crying Drunk Girl's character read: The Crying Drunk Girl, Mary Hampson, attended college for nearly two years, then dropped out to become a tour guide at the White House, a job she still holds. Her favorite times at work is leading groups of school children in an enthusiastic rendition of the Pledge of Allegiance.",

In the director's cut, Champ says \"I woke up this morning and I shit a squirrel. The hell of it is, the damn thing's still alive. So I've got this shit covered squirrel down there in the office, and I don't know what to name it.\" Brick replies, \"I'm sorry, I think I ate your chocolate squirrel\". - The scene of Ron Burgundy walking around the office with an erection is extended by about fifteen seconds. - Ron daydreams of being married to Veronica, and has two children. After coming home from work, she appears from the kitchen in negligee, tells him that she's just prepared dinner in the nude, and they somewhat violently make out in the hallway. - The scene of Ron being carried away by the crowd after reading the phrase \"Go fuck yourself, San Diego\" on the air is extended, with Ron screaming, \"I would never say fuck! I would never fucking ever fucking say that!\" - After the above, Ron goes to Tino's where he is forced to eat cat poop in regards to the above incident.",

In the new cut, after Lilian admits crapping her wedding dress, Annie starts to feel uncomfortable, gets out of the car and throws up. - When Annie is at the bathroom, Gil (Matt Lucas) and his sister were in the bathtub together. He asks Annie to hand her the disposable shaver and shaves his sister's armpits. - There's a new 5-minute scene where Annie has a date with a guy called Pete. While waiting at the living room for Pete to get ready, she has a very uncomfortable conversation with his son Taylor (he's talking about \"fear of dying\", asking about Annie replacing his mother, etc..). After Annie goes upstairs, she overhears Pete talking on the phone telling his wife how he missed her and describes Annie as unattractive. Shocked by that, she went back downstairs and saw Taylor taking some contraceptive pills before leaving the house hastily. - The home video of Megan (Melissa McCarthy) and Jon (Ben Falcone) is slightly longer. She sticks a slice of ham on his chest and eats them. However, Jon's reaction doesn't tell whether he likes it or not.",

Both variations featured a hard-rock version of \"We're the Chipmunks\". When the first 11 episodes of season 6 were syndicated, the show used the original opening from the first 5 seasons, but with the new version of \"We're the Chipmunks\" dubbed over.",

        "The New Extended cut has many extended scenes. Among them: - While the officers are watching the news coverage before the briefing where they meet Hunter, there is extended coverage of the news person Sarah interviewing Radchenko. One of the men makes a comment about her breasts. - This version shows several of the submariners leaving their families, including Lt. Ince (Viggo Mortensen) saluting his son (played by his real son), Marichek, and others. - Interspersed with the previous extended leaving scene is the submarine movie trivia game on the bus with a few added lines about an invalid question and one owing the other money. - Hunter's jogging scene before the fire is slightly extended. - After the drill, in the Captains cabin, Ramsey asks Hunter to speak to COB about his weight, stating a personal aversion to doing it because they've served together so long. He then makes the 'WWIII, ship being sunk, giant octopus\" statement. - Just before encountering the Akula for the first time while getting an EAM, COB reports to Hunter's cabin while Hunter is shaving. Hunter says that the subject is uncomfortable. COB, almost jovial, says he knows he's overweight, but this is his last patrol and he can't stop eating. They laugh. COB tells Hunter that he thinks Hunter and Ramsey merely have a difference of management styles. Then they go get something to eat. - Just before the Akula launches torpedoes after the winch noise, a comment is made that the Akula is 'range gating' and the sonar tech asks 'What is range gating?' and another says 'It means they have their torpedoes locked on us, stupid!' - During the explosion of the second torpedo (while Ramsey is still in command), an additional shot of a crewman falling down a ladder is added. - We see Rivetti leave sonar, saying 'I've gotta take a whiz' when he goes to release Hunter. - We see COB going into the Naval Inquiry, with Zimmer leaving very upset. COB then leaves, head down. Next, Ramsey is called into the inquiry. All the while we see Hunter waiting. Then he is called in. - The Admiral asks Hunter if he thinks his recollection of the events differs from his Captain's, just before saying 'I have known Capt Ramsey'... etc. - Although the overall score is intact, several scenes had different arrangements.",

        "The home video release of this has a huge number of differences to the original TV version. Many of the scenes are shuffled in order and are much re-edited, and of most note is that much of the original dialogue is dubbed with especially recorded alternate versions, with much stronger swearing (including several instances of the \"f\" word) Some elements of the story (generally ones that would continue as threads in the TV series) are completely eliminated. Various differences include: - The opening credits captions are different, running slower. - A different version of the theme tune is played on the opening sequence. - Archangel discussing with the Senator the development of Airwolf (which gives much of the project's background) is much abridged. - Shots of Airwolf's on-board radar and maintanance screens are completely different. - Numerous scenes have different backing scores and sound effects. - A couple of close-ups of the photos in Hawke's cabin are of completely different photos to the original version. - For some reason, (most of) the story behind the paintings adorning the walls in Hawke's cabin is removed. - On the TV version, before Moffet and his crew head off to Libya in Airwolf, they destory a fighter jet over the desert. On the video version, there is a completely different version of the effectivley the same scene, with them destroying three figher jets over the ocean. - Asides from adding much stronger language, the video release also for some reason also changes numerous lines of dialogue. For pure example, when Hawke tells Dominic that he's got a tough mission for the pair of them, Dominic quips \"What're we gonna do, kidnap Kadaffi?\"; the TV version's \"Nothing that simple\" becomes \"No, a helicopter\". There's numerous other instances of lines of dialogue being changed. - The closing credits are (slightly) different. - The whole chunk of story of where Hawke and Dominic find a hiding place for Airwolf for after they retreive it (in a hollow mountain) and the whole last few minutes after Hawke's recovered & hidden Airwolf, and saying he'll only return it if the Firm find solid information on his missing brother, are completely gone. - The video version finishes (rather abruptly) with Hawke and Dominic having defeated Moffet, flying off over the ocean into the sun-set (in a piece of footage used on the TV episode 'Mad Over Miami') and the film finishing; as opposed to the TV version which has several more minutes with Hawke and Archangel discussing the return of Airwolf on condition that Hawke's brother is found, then Hawke going back out to the lake to play his cello. - Interestingly, there is a scene where twisted creator Dr. Moffet is torturing the kidnapped Gabrielle in the desert, that was in the original TV version but not on this release. This scene is quite strong and as a result is often edited out by many TV showings; considering the stronger nature of the video version, it's surprising it was not included. As this scene is not on the video release and is often cut out on TV, it could be considered to be quite rare",

A slightly longer opening sequence on the model's runway where a skinny audience members mumbles \"I both love it and I hate it\" before the first model blimps up. - 2. In the first Tender Loins sequence, there is new footage starting with a conversation with the bartender and Persephone about her new boyfriend, whose brother she is going to meet. The boyfriend shows up and his brother is revealed to be his Siamese twin with an inexplicable British accent and snooty, patrician attitude. The manager then panics because Erotica hasn't shown up for work. This segues into a sequence where Erotica as Stripperella (This is Stripperella's (And Erotica's)first appearance in the two-parter, NOT the reveal of Erotica as she starts her act in the Tender Loins, as it is in the single episode version) rescues a baby from the lion's pit at a zoo. Giving the baby to its mother she is thanked but griped at because she destroyed the baby's heirloom blanket. She then talks to the zoo-keeper about moving the lion's pit to a place farther from the kids play area. She continues to give a lecture about increasing the lion's pit size before looking at her watch and realizing that she is late for work. Then we see a sign on the front of the Tender Loins advertising \"The Best Cervix in Town!\" The original footage picks up here. This whole sequence lasts for about 2 1/2 minutes. - 3. When Stripperella enters Flinderman's en route to FUGG headquarters, new footage has her stop to admire a shoe sale before her navel ring beeper beeps again, causing her to continue running to the secret door to the headquarters. - 4. After another model blimps up at the Stiffy Woods concert video, new footage shows a scene in the Tender Loins as Persephone is talking with her boyfriend. It starts when Persephone eats a Marcino cherry, revealing that she is able to do origami with her tongue when she works the stem and makes a miniature model of the Eiffel Tower. Her boyfriend is impressed, but the snotty Brit wannabe Siamese bother asks her if she learned that trick at \"whore school\". The date continues until the boyfriend chokes. Persephone performs the Heimlich maneuver, explaining that lots of strippers choke when they grab dollar bills with their teeth. The Brit wannabe remarks sarcastically about the anecdote, resulting in an argument. This lasts a little over a minute. - 5. The scene introducing Dr. Cesearean is extended when he makes the joke about seeing Enorma \"in the obituary column!\" The original scene ended when he went back into his office, whereas the new one continues with him laughing maniacally in his office as the the camera pulls out and reveals his waiting room filled with shocked onlookers. This ends with a \"To Be Continued\". - 6. The \"Next on Stripperella\" segment shows footage from Part Two, including a scene showing the Siamese twins fighting each other. - PART ONE runs for about 22 minutes without commercial.",

This version has the following scenes reinstated: - A guardsman named Mr. Widdenfield (played by Arthur Malet) harasses Captain Greer, while Mrs. Hobday tries to clear things out (leading into the song \"The Old Home Guard\"). - A Home Guard sergeant asking for permission to dismiss the marching parade (immediately after \"The Old Home Guard\" ends). - Mr. Jelk tells Mrs. Hobday of his plans to buy Miss Price's house. - At dinner time, Carrie tells Miss Price she and her brothers are orphans, while she explains what happened to their caretaker, Aunt Bessie. - Miss Price notes mango-wurzel jam is available at the dinner table, and they say grace, as the children look disgusted at Miss Price's tastes in food. - Miss Price tells the children no one has ever seen her workroom before. - As Mr. Jelk brings a letter to Miss Price (the one that informs her the Emelius Browne Correspondence College of Witchcraft has closed), he tries to get into the house and talk to her, but she politely sends him away. - When Miss Price asks Paul for the bedknob back to get to London, Charlie attempts to extort some money from her, but she rebuffs him. - After \"The Age of Not Believing,\" Paul tries to get the bed to fly, but Miss Price forgot to tell him to tell the knob where to take them. - When the children find Mr. Browne on the streets of London, they take the bed with them and follow him. - The entire song \"With a Flair\" and its lead-in, as well as Mr. Browne's subsequent offer to sell his magic props. - When Miss Price says \"we'd be delighted [to join Mr. Browne for luncheon],\" Mr. Browne asks if the children belong to her. - At the townhouse where Mr. Browne is staying, Miss Price explains to her what substitutiary locomotion is and why she wants the spell. - The second nursery scene, in which Paul discovers the book \"Isle of Naboombu,\" is put before \"Eglantine\", whereas it was formerly after it. - The song \"Eglantine\" is restored to its entirety. - The song \"Portobello Road\" is restored to its entirety, as its subsequent dance sequence. The main song adds a scene with a used clothing merchant and another scene where Charlie and Paul play cricket. In the dance, the Caribbean dance now precedes the Irish dance. Unlike the rest of the formerly cut scenes, the tail end of the Irish dance and the beginning of the dance's climax only existed as a faded work-print that had to be digitally scanned and cleaned before it could be brought back to a passable state. - Mr. Browne tells Swinburne that the bed once belonged to royalty and is being offered to the Bookman as a present, while the children push the bed through the door. - Mr. Browne rebuffs the Bookman's offer to swap sections of the book, but relents when he is threatened. - A scene in the village store where Mrs. Hobday meets Mr. Browne and suggests he should marry Miss Price. Mr. Jelk walks in and overhears them. - The song \"Nobody's Problem's for Me\" is reinstated after Mr. Browne leaves the house. No orchestral track existed, so the studio recorded a new one.",
