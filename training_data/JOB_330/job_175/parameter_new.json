(0:21) - After Cheng and Duan are accosted by rioting students, after the photo session. They are being carted through the streets on handcarts. Na Kun is following, on foot. They discuss first the student revolutionaries, and then the incident at Old Man Zhang's house, which is now a coffin shop. Dieyi mentions that he was there the day before; Na conjectures that he was probably looking for the sword. (0:51) - After Cheng and Duan meet Yuan Shiqing for the first time, and Cheng is presented with jewelry. Brief dialogue as Yuan and then Duan leave the room. (0:19) - After Cheng and Duan argue in the makeup room, right before Juxian leaves the House of Blossoms. Juxian watches a performance of \"Farewell\". (0:55) - After Cheng and Duan argue during the \"engagement\" scene, right before Cheng tucks the baby Xiao Si into bed. Yuan presents Cheng with an elaborate pheasant headdress in his dressing room. (0:51) - After Japan's march into Beijing, right before Duan gets into a fight with the Japanese. Another opera scene, dealing with drink. Also one line of dialogue as Juxian applies Duan's makeup. (1:31) - Scene of Cheng singing to Japanese continues, right before Duan is released. Interior shots, Cheng holding a fan. Music, and applause. (0:47) - More graphic detail in the bloodletting scene. - Brief shot of Duan caressing Juxian's cheek, right after Cheng and Yuan makeup scene. - After our first glance of Cheng smoking opium, right before Cheng and Duan visit their old teacher. Cheng steps out of his home, smoking and looking quite listless. He chokes as a car passes. Then we see Juxian showing a group of Duan's friends to the exit of their home, recovering money that her husband has lent them. Juxian complains that Duan doesn't have a real job; Duan responds that all he can do is sing, and Juxian has forbidden that. Juxian mentions that Duan and Cheng's old teacher wants to see them; Duan says that he is too ashamed to face him. (2:02) - After Juxian visits Cheng in his cell, just before trial. Beginning of the trial dialogue cut, where Peking Opera is described as \"pornographic music\", and the formal charges of collusion with the Japanese Officer, Aoki, are described. (0:43) - Later, in the same trial scene, after Na's \"testimony\", Yuan objects to the idea of Peking Opera as \"pornographic music\".  (1:01) - After the communists march into Beijing, Cheng and Duan are performing \"Farewell\" to an audience of communist troops. The troops do not respond, and then break into a patriotic song afterwards. Xiao Si seems to take to their philosophy. This scene cuts into what seems to be one large crowd scene in the U.S. release -- everything depicting Xiao Si (the foundling) skipping through the streets of Beijing comes after this scene. (1:52) - After Juxian's suicide, and before we cut to the present day, we get a short scene where the traitorous Xiao Si seems to get his due. He is sitting alone with the case of jewelry given Cheng by Yuan, and singing from \"Farewell\". Behind him, communist troops begin to file in, and Xiao Si is startled to see them in the mirror. One of them approaches and hands him what seems to be some sort of summons. (1:11)",

In the work print he takes two bloody bullet hits in the back and then there is another shot of 3 more coming out of his chest and as he falls to the ground you can see another shot of him from behind taking another 3 hits before hitting the ground. - In the R rated version Evan is fired upon and doesn't appear to be hit until Frank finds him later. In the work print Kynette forces Travers shoot at Evan you then see Evan take a bullet through the shoulder in slow-motion which explains why he appears to have been shot when Frank finds him later on. - The fight between Gabe and Kynette has been shortened for the R rated version which misses shots of Gabe and Jessie being beaten further after Kynette asks for the *third* time where the money is (this is missing in the R rated version which leads to a continuity error as he said he would ask three times)The impaling of Kynette has been shortened, in the work print there is more focus on Kynette's eyes going back into his head and Gabe gritting his teeth holding Kynette up on the stalagmite as he is dying before finally dropping him. - When Hal and Delmar fight the R rated version has removed a shot of Delmar kicking Hal hard in the kidneys and saying \"Tell me how are we feeling so far?\" as opposed to the R rated version \"Tell me do you like soccer\" they have been edited together and this now explains why Delmar appears out of breath when he asks the soccer question. - When Hal shoots Delmar with the shotgun in the work print you see Craig Fairbrass get shot with a large splatter of blood behind him and a bloody shotgun wound to his chest as he dives off the mountain. The R rated version shows a different angle with a stuntman falling off the mountain. Additionally the work print shows Delmar's body slamming into the rocks below where as the R rated version cuts away just before. - When Qualen shoots Kristel in the work print all three bloody bullet impacts are shown, in the R rated version it cuts away after the first shot to show Traver's reaction. - The Gabe and Travers fight has been edited (this might not be censorship, apparently the filmmakers decided it would be better to have Gabe shoot Traver's with his piton gun before falling under the ice as per the R rated version) in the work print Gabe shoots Traver's once with the piton gun and Traver's gets up and tries to shoot Gabe through the ice and is then shot by Hal three times with a shotgun before falling under the ice (this explains why Hal appears with a shotgun in the R rated version). - The ending fight with Gabe and Qualen has been shortened so kidney punches, an arm break and a longer shot of a terrified Qualen crashing to his death in the helicopter were taken out.",

This includes two excellent scenes cut from every version of the movie. At the beginning, as Arthur yells \"To the pit!\" the little bald guy with the whip (Gold Tooth) says \"To the pit with the blackguard!\" and charges Ash on his horse. Ash knocks him off the horse with his shotgun and is sucker-punched by Arthur, which Ash doesn't like, and knocks Arthur down. Arthur is shocked, but recovers to slap Ash's face lightly and order his men to \"Secure the prisoner.\" They do.  Another scene explains the mirror thing a little better, as Ash leaves the windmill to walk through an ominous forest, accidentally knocking into his horse. Saying \"You big piece of hamburger, c'mere,\" he ties the horse down until seeing a duplicate of himself in the windmill's doorway, which then slams shut. He runs back into the windmill and smashes headfirst into a mirror. These scenes are included in VERY rough scratched-up form in the \"director's cut\" DVD/VHS, along with another scene in which Ash is captured by Henry's men, including Rob Tapert. Henry stops them from killing Ash and laughs, calling Ash \"Mr. Fancypants.\" Ash convinces Henry to fight with him, saying \"You owe me.\" There is also an alternate opening on the DVD which is much more horror-like, omitting the S-Mart material and including more \"Evil Dead 2\"-style footage. This matches with the \"end of the world\" ending, as Ash appears to have a beard (only his eyes are shown to avoid giving this away too much).",

The flashback sequence involves Ricky, Ethel and Fred discussing the health of Lucy's new born baby. Ethel offers some homemade cookies for Lucy, but Ricky explains that Lucy is worried about her figure, and would like to go on a diet. The three then remember the last time Lucy went on a diet.

The film was formally resubmitted to the Classification Board in 1989, who re-affirmed the ban. An appeal saw the film's ban lifted and an R18+ rating issued. This version was released on the CBS/Fox home video label. This home video version's opening credits, and the climax featuring Z-Man shooting a woman in her bed, were re-edited.

Both shots last the same length of time and use the same take, the amount of blood was simply toned down digitally for the MPAA.

        "The series pilot, \"Beauty and the Obese\", was first released as a 1/2-hour single episode and then as a longer 2-part episode with new footage. New stuff includes: - PART ONE -- 1. A slightly longer opening sequence on the model's runway where a skinny audience members mumbles \"I both love it and I hate it\" before the first model blimps up. - 2. In the first Tender Loins sequence, there is new footage starting with a conversation with the bartender and Persephone about her new boyfriend, whose brother she is going to meet. The boyfriend shows up and his brother is revealed to be his Siamese twin with an inexplicable British accent and snooty, patrician attitude. The manager then panics because Erotica hasn't shown up for work. This segues into a sequence where Erotica as Stripperella (This is Stripperella's (And Erotica's)first appearance in the two-parter, NOT the reveal of Erotica as she starts her act in the Tender Loins, as it is in the single episode version) rescues a baby from the lion's pit at a zoo. Giving the baby to its mother she is thanked but griped at because she destroyed the baby's heirloom blanket. She then talks to the zoo-keeper about moving the lion's pit to a place farther from the kids play area. She continues to give a lecture about increasing the lion's pit size before looking at her watch and realizing that she is late for work. Then we see a sign on the front of the Tender Loins advertising \"The Best Cervix in Town!\" The original footage picks up here. This whole sequence lasts for about 2 1/2 minutes. - 3. When Stripperella enters Flinderman's en route to FUGG headquarters, new footage has her stop to admire a shoe sale before her navel ring beeper beeps again, causing her to continue running to the secret door to the headquarters. - 4. After another model blimps up at the Stiffy Woods concert video, new footage shows a scene in the Tender Loins as Persephone is talking with her boyfriend. It starts when Persephone eats a Marcino cherry, revealing that she is able to do origami with her tongue when she works the stem and makes a miniature model of the Eiffel Tower. Her boyfriend is impressed, but the snotty Brit wannabe Siamese bother asks her if she learned that trick at \"whore school\". The date continues until the boyfriend chokes. Persephone performs the Heimlich maneuver, explaining that lots of strippers choke when they grab dollar bills with their teeth. The Brit wannabe remarks sarcastically about the anecdote, resulting in an argument. This lasts a little over a minute. - 5. The scene introducing Dr. Cesearean is extended when he makes the joke about seeing Enorma \"in the obituary column!\" The original scene ended when he went back into his office, whereas the new one continues with him laughing maniacally in his office as the the camera pulls out and reveals his waiting room filled with shocked onlookers. This ends with a \"To Be Continued\". - 6. The \"Next on Stripperella\" segment shows footage from Part Two, including a scene showing the Siamese twins fighting each other. - PART ONE runs for about 22 minutes without commercial.",

        "The Serbian DVD version is 160 minutes long and is a significantly different cut from any other DVD or video releases. There is no opening map and narration. The musical score is the original Vladimir Kraus-Rajteric score which kicks in very rarely. The scenes are rearranged so that Welles makes his speech to the troops near the beginning and the air attack hits Bihac simultaneously with the land battle. Almost every dialog scene is lengthened and cut slower than the English version, but there are some parts of the action scenes cut a lot tighter. For instance, this is missing the scene where Riva falls out of the truck during the Italian retreat. It is also missing the scene in the Orthodox church prior the Welles addressing the Chetniks. However, it does feature several new scenes, most notably a scene where Vasco raids a house in Prosor only to then shoot and wound his own commander, and then a second battle between the Partisans and the Italians. In this scene, Riva refuses to fire at his own men and Novak almost shoots him only for Martin to intervene. General Morelli is captured and then promptly commits suicide with a pistol. There is also a new scene where the partisans surprise attack a group of Chetniks guarding the Neretva bridge. There are several more violent shots missing from other prints - such as the Ustashans hanging an old woman and laughing when they march through Bihac. There are several more deaths during the end battle with the Chetniks such as a partisan being shot in the back when reaching for a grenade. Then at the end of the battle there is a scene where a partisan named 'Stipe' goes crazy and guns down a number of Chetnik prisoners, only to have his rank stripped from him. Curiously almost all the nationalities speak their own language; with Riva speaking Italian even with his Yugoslavian captors and Morelli speaking in German when addressing General Lohring. The only actors dubbed appear to be Yul Brynner and Orson Welles.",

        "The laserdisc release features a separate section with the scenes not included in the theatrical release. This is the new material: - After being awakened from hypersleep, Kane wanders out to the kitchen to prepare breakfast, he says \"Rise and shine Lambert\". - The crew gathers on the bridge and listens to the signal coming from the derelict craft. - Lambert confronts Ripley about Ripley's reluctance to let them back on the ship with Kane and the facehugger.  Lambert tells Ripley, Parker and Brett how the face hugger got on Kane. - Ripley radios down to Parker and Brett to see how they're progressing on the repairs, Parker and Ripley exchange tense words over the radio. - After the face hugger's acid eats through a few floors, the crew returns to the med lab to check up on Kane's condition.  Ripley sees an X-Ray of Kane's chest and asks Ash, \"What is that dark stain on Kane's lung?\"  The rest of the crew starts asking if Kane's going to live, Dallas tells everyone to go back to work. - After Kane's death, the crew gathers around at the meal table to discuss what they're going to do with the escaped alien.  Brett announces the cattle-prod idea and suggests \"catching\" the alien in a net. - Longer version of Brett's death.  This scene had Brett frozen with fear as the alien grabs his head, he yells \"Parker!\" and then blood poors from beneath his cap.  The alien lifts him up into the landing gear and Ripley and Parker come rushing in.  Parker stands where Brett once was and looks up; blood drips on his shirt and then Brett's cattle prod falls to Parker's feet. - Part of a scene that involves Parker, Ripley and Lambert trying to flush the alien out of the air lock.  As they are about to succeed, an alarm is triggered and the alien rushes out of the airlock (getting its tail caught in the closing door, and spilling acid that causes a hull breach).  Parker falls unconciously to the floor, Ripley does the same and Lambert and Ash come to their rescue.  Ripley vocalizes her suspicions about Ash by accusing him of setting the alarm off. - After Dallas's disappearance, Ripley (being suspicious of Ash) asks Lambert if she's ever slept with him. - The build-up to Lambert's death is much longer.  (Watch the alien's shadow on the wall, it walks in, crouches down, then immediately gets up) A scene where we see the alien enter, crouch down and wait until Lambert notices its presence was cut.  When Lambert sees the alien, it uncoils its tail and walks (like a crab) over to Lambert. - After Ripley discovers the remains of Parker and Lambert, she makes another discovery.  Ripley enters the landing gear area of the Nostromo (where Brett got killed) and discovers a cocooned Dallas and Brett mutating into an egg. Dallas pleads, \"Kill me\".  Ripley flames Dallas and the Brett-egg and then runs to set the ship on self-destruct.",

Altered in the sense that everything except the running storyline of the episode was cut, resulting in the running time dropping from one hour to 12 to 17 minutes.  To fill the running time, elements from the 1981-1982 \"Wake up\" version (none of which were made into PBS versions), and other late episodes, such as Bill Cosby's \"Picture Pages\" segments, and scenes with Kevin Clash's troupe of puppets, making each episode around 28 minutes on PBS.  These versions also featured a new theme song (the much more upbeat \"Here Comes Captain Kangaroo!\" theme replaced the CBS \"Good Morning, Captain\" opening) and opening credit segment,  showing clips from the series rather than the previous, partly animated opening. One of the many hour-long videos released in 1984-1986 (when the show was between homes) was \"Captain Kangaroo and His Friends\".  This tape featured PBS-like versions of the episodes featuring Joan Rivers, Phil Donahue, and Dolly Parton, as well as scenes with Town Clown and the Bananna Man.\tNew intro's with the Captain were also inserted.\tReportedly, this has been aired as a special on PBS during pledge drives while the show was on the air.",

Most notable of all is the live-action opening intro, in which shots of corpses during Chris' narration is replaced by newspaper pages, the decapitated hand found by Joseph is only shown briefly and Joseph's death scene (in which he fights shoots a zombie dog in the eye before being mutilated) was shortened. In addition, Chris was originally shown lighting a cigarette during the cast's introduction (this was replaced by superimposed colored footage of early shots of Chris from the intro). The second FMV movie altered was with the encounter with the first Zombie, in which showed Kenneth's half-eaten head is drop into the floor before the zombie himself faces the player. The third and final FMV that was change was Chris' \"bad\" ending, which was reshot so that Chris is no longer shown smoking (SCEA reportedly forbids any \"glorification\" of tobacco use in their games, despite the fact that SCEI has no problem with them). Virgin's PC port is the only version in the US to contain all the FMV intact with the opening intro being shown in color (the original Japanese was in black & white).",

First, they had already broadcast two episodes of entertainment series that were clearly against U.S.  involvement in southeast Asia (\"Route 66\", March 22, 1963; \"Twilight Zone\", Sept.  27, 1963). Secondly, the drugs in \"Harmony\" are quite different from those used in other \"Prisoner\" episodes. On most occasions, they have no more in common with recreational \"junk\" than truth serum as seen in more realistic spy dramas, while the plan here was to take our hero and \"fill him with hallucinotory drugs....dis-orient him\" according to the episode's dialogue. There is actually a third theory that is more likely than either of those.  \"Living In Harmony\" is not identified as a segment of \"The Prisoner\" until the end, unless you recognize star Patrick McGoohan, the parallels to \"Arrival\", and the typeface used in what credits there are (the episode title appears to be the series title).  When the program was first broadcast in the U.K., in some regions (it wasn't shown simultaneously across the country as in the U.S.) superimposed the words \"The Prisoner\" over the image at the beginning.  Star/Executive Producer/Creative driving force Patrick McGoohan reportedly didn't like this at all, but it would have forewarned him to contractually prohibit CBS from doing the same thing. According to this theory, CBS declined to air the episode rather than gamble on the intelligence of their audience.",

After the Solomon Grundy animation, a film that features a girl washing herself and explaining about things that need washing and cleaning up (Getting Clean with Water) has Western classical music performed by the Swingle Singers on its soundtrack, but the rights to that group's recordings are controlled by the Universal Music Group and could not be secured for the DVD release. In its place, the film with famous Joe Raposo song \"Good Things Growin' Better Every Day (A Little Bit at the Beginning)\" (also known as \"Beginnings\") is shown instead after Sally is introduced to Oscar, which is shorter than the film it replaced and, therefore, that version of the episode has a shorter running time. The sketch featuring Gordon and the Anything Muppets ends right before the scene from the original version where they performed \"Consider Yourself\" from _Oliver! (1968)_ (qv). Also, a graphic with a 2006 copyright notice attributed to Sesame Workshop and the ownership of Kermit the Frog and the word \"Muppet\" attributed to Muppets Holding Company LLC, a wholly owned entity of the Walt Disney Company, is added to the funding segment at the end of the episode.

This version has the following scenes reinstated: - A guardsman named Mr. Widdenfield (played by Arthur Malet) harasses Captain Greer, while Mrs. Hobday tries to clear things out (leading into the song \"The Old Home Guard\"). - A Home Guard sergeant asking for permission to dismiss the marching parade (immediately after \"The Old Home Guard\" ends). - Mr. Jelk tells Mrs. Hobday of his plans to buy Miss Price's house. - At dinner time, Carrie tells Miss Price she and her brothers are orphans, while she explains what happened to their caretaker, Aunt Bessie. - Miss Price notes mango-wurzel jam is available at the dinner table, and they say grace, as the children look disgusted at Miss Price's tastes in food. - Miss Price tells the children no one has ever seen her workroom before. - As Mr. Jelk brings a letter to Miss Price (the one that informs her the Emelius Browne Correspondence College of Witchcraft has closed), he tries to get into the house and talk to her, but she politely sends him away. - When Miss Price asks Paul for the bedknob back to get to London, Charlie attempts to extort some money from her, but she rebuffs him. - After \"The Age of Not Believing,\" Paul tries to get the bed to fly, but Miss Price forgot to tell him to tell the knob where to take them. - When the children find Mr. Browne on the streets of London, they take the bed with them and follow him. - The entire song \"With a Flair\" and its lead-in, as well as Mr. Browne's subsequent offer to sell his magic props. - When Miss Price says \"we'd be delighted [to join Mr. Browne for luncheon],\" Mr. Browne asks if the children belong to her. - At the townhouse where Mr. Browne is staying, Miss Price explains to her what substitutiary locomotion is and why she wants the spell. - The second nursery scene, in which Paul discovers the book \"Isle of Naboombu,\" is put before \"Eglantine\", whereas it was formerly after it. - The song \"Eglantine\" is restored to its entirety. - The song \"Portobello Road\" is restored to its entirety, as its subsequent dance sequence. The main song adds a scene with a used clothing merchant and another scene where Charlie and Paul play cricket. In the dance, the Caribbean dance now precedes the Irish dance. Unlike the rest of the formerly cut scenes, the tail end of the Irish dance and the beginning of the dance's climax only existed as a faded work-print that had to be digitally scanned and cleaned before it could be brought back to a passable state. - Mr. Browne tells Swinburne that the bed once belonged to royalty and is being offered to the Bookman as a present, while the children push the bed through the door. - Mr. Browne rebuffs the Bookman's offer to swap sections of the book, but relents when he is threatened. - A scene in the village store where Mrs. Hobday meets Mr. Browne and suggests he should marry Miss Price. Mr. Jelk walks in and overhears them. - The song \"Nobody's Problem's for Me\" is reinstated after Mr. Browne leaves the house. No orchestral track existed, so the studio recorded a new one.",

        "Several scenes (most of which can be read in the film's script) were shot but removed or altered for various reasons, either for content or to keep the running time under two hours. These scenes are, in chronological order: - The earliest versions had Clyde shooting and killing the butcher during their fight. This was toned down to Clyde just shooting the butcher, and finally just pistol whipping him. In real life, speculation still exists as to whether 'Clyde Barrow' (qv) actually committed the crime this is based on; although his photo was picked out, the method in which it was executed doesn't fit his MO. In the final cut, there is a brief jump in the film during the fight, where it was spliced from the original, more graphic conclusion. - After picking up C.W., Clyde and Bonnie take him to a diner where they plan their next robbery. - After Clyde kills Doyle Johnson (the man on the running board), Bonnie talks with CW in the bathroom while Clyde cleans his guns and laments his actions. In the bathroom CW bathes and Bonnie attempts to seduce him, but changes her mind when CW proves to be less than romantic material. A still from this scene-- Bonnie wearing a slip and Clyde's hat-- can be seen on the DVD. - A longer scene of Buck and Blanche's approach to the motor lodge. Buck is singing Bible hymns and Blanche scolds him for bringing her to see Clyde. - A longer version of Bonnie's visit home; she sits in the car and her sister gives her a perm (a portion of this-- Bonnie on the running board getting her hair put up-- exists in the final film). - A very long sequence in which Bonnie and Clyde get drunk and come to terms with their impending death. They trash their room and rip out the mattress from their bed, turning it into a makeshift coffin. They then put on their best clothes and put makeup on each other so they can see what they will look like when they're dead. The scene concludes with Bonnie and Clyde dancing around CW by candlelight and chanting \"The Hearse Song.\" - During the Platte City raid, C.W. uses a machine gun to attack the armored car instead of grenades. - The final shootout, in it's earliest form, was done entirely with still photos shown over sounds of machine gun fire and screams, and we never actually saw Bonnie or Clyde dead. The movie ended with the two farmers running towards the car while \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\" Played in the background.",

At several points in this episode, guns are pointed at people threateningly, and warning shots are fired. Also, Meowth shows up in a scene dressed with a Hitler-like mustache. Due to the sensitivity of the American public to guns in children's shows (particularly the image of a child being threatened with a gun) this episode was never aired for American circulation. The removal of this episode leads to continuity problems, as Ash captured 30 Tauros in this episode.

        "The Sid Sheinberg Edit, never released but prepared for syndicated television, makes many significant changes. Several lines of dialogue were changed, using many alternative and unused shots. The movie was edited down to 94 minutes, removing many major scenes, placing more emphasis on Tuttle's character and Sam's relationship with Jill. - The opening Central Services advertisement for ducts stops just before the shop window explodes. It then cuts straight to the restaurant explosion scene, with none of the dialogue leading up to it, beginning only with Shirley offering Sam the salt and the following explosion. The title \"Brazil\" then appears and the scene ends. - During the prologue in which the fly falls in the typewriter, the scene cuts back and forth to text on a computer screen explaining the plot premise, including a voice over reading it aloud. - All the fantasy sequences are missing, except the scene of Sam flying through clouds - which is shortened and has a glowing effect applied to indicate it is a dream. - Extended dialogue in the scenes where Sam meets Jack at Information Retrieval, before he is distracted by Jill on the TV screens. The screens change to show Jill as she appears in Sam's dreams. - It is never stated that Mr Buttle is dead, only asked by his wife. - When Sam goes to visit Mrs Buttle at Shangri-La Towers, instead of morosely screaming \"What have you done with his body?\" she begins hitting Sam with paper with the line \"Lousy bastard\" dubbed over. - Lots of the swearing was dubbed over with tamer dialogue, often very badly. Several of Sam's swears are replaced with \"Judas!\". - Alternative dialogue in the scene in Jack's office. In this version, Sam puts on the suit earlier before having a conversation with Jack about Tuttle, and Jack's daughter is never shown on screen. - A cut of Casablanca featuring the line \"Here's lookin' at you, kid.\" Right after Sam leaves Kurtzmann's office. - Extended dialogue between Jill and Sam in the truck. - You don't see the guard on fire when the Police vehicle crashes after the truck chase. - When armed guards manhandle Jill after the apartment store explosion, Sam simply picks up a plastic arm from a shop dummy and prepares to fight. The giant samurai warrior is not seen at all in this version. - Extended, more romantic dialogue between Sam and Jill after Tuttle switches the pipes at Sam's flat. Jill explains to Sam that she \"looked him up\" to find out where he lived. - After Sam is arrested, it cuts straight to the torture chamber scene, as in the US theatrical cut. However, Jack's mask is never explicitly shown and a different, close-up shot is used when Jack confronts Sam in the chair. - After the ministry building is blown up, a 'deleted' form ordering the arrest of Harry Tuttle is shown on screen. The following scene of Tuttle being attacked by paper is then taken out of context, implying the Ministry is eliminating him using supernatural powers (it is not revealed to be a dream in this version). - After Tuttle's disappearance, it cuts immediately to Sam and Jill driving in the truck, with no explanation for how they escaped arrest. There is then a sequence set in the countryside showing Jill on a farm. Sam is shown asleep in bed (re-using a shot from earlier the film). The camera zooms to show a picture on the wall of a winged Sam, before cutting to a dream shot of Sam carrying Jill and flying up into the clouds. - The credits are displayed on a background of clouds. However, the image of Sam sitting in the torture chair is still visible superimposed over it, as seen in the US theatrical cut.",

In the original cut, there is an opening narration by Captain Kirk stating: \"Enterprise Log: Captain James Kirk commanding. We are leaving that vast cloud of stars and planets which we call our galaxy. Behind us: Earth, Mars, Venus, even our sun are specks of dust. A question: what is out there in the black void beyond? Until now our mission has been that of space law regulation, contact with Earth colonies and investigation of alien life. But now, a new task; a probe out into where no man has gone before.\" followed by the words \"STAR TREK\" appearing on screen. They fade away and are replaced by \"STARRING WILLIAM SHATNER.\" The episode then moves into act one, with the words \"STAR TREK ACT I\" appearing on screen. The episode then proceeds as normal until Scotty says \"It's begun transmitting, sir.\" at which point, the words \"TONIGHT'S EPISODE 'WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE'\" appear. After which, there is an extended pan of the Enterprise hallways with the titles \"CO-STARRING LENOARD NIMOY AS MR. SPOCK\" appearing and fading away, followed by \"GUEST STARS GARY LOCKWOOD AND SALLY KELLERMAN.\" Over this scene, the red alert klaxon blares and Lieutenant Kelso repeatedly saying \"Bridge to all decks. Condition: alert!\" We also see Gary Mitchell walking around the corridors as well until finally cutting to Kirk and Spock entering the turbolift, at which point the episode continues as normal. Additionally, the end credits were much different in this original cut. Instead of the normal \"Star Trek\" theme playing, a different piece is used and the credits only credit the supporting characters; none of whom are referenced by name. (For example: PAUL FIX AS: SHIP'S DOCTOR, GEORGE TAKEI AS: CHIEF PHYSICIST, JAMES DOOHAN AS: ENGINEERING CHIEF, etc.)",

The Ultimate Edition also includes several deleted scenes: - when Conan and Subotai first enter the village, they are shown stopping by a vendor (played by director John Milius) selling lizard-on-a-stick. The vendor says, \"Want food? This is on a stick...fresh. Quick, there are many to feed!\" Shortly thereafter in the film, Conan remarks that the food is good, to which Subotai replies, \"You have no idea how long it's been there!\" - a scene of silhouettes on a wall fighting - a cut scene of King Osric being attacked and killed in his throne-room by (presumably) Doom's soldiers - another cut scene of King Osric's demise, shot from a different angle, which ends with him staring at the reflection of his dying self in a mirror astride the throne, which he then shatters with his sword before collapsing An outtake is also included that takes place just after Conan is freed from bondage, and is climbing the rocks leading to the Atlantean General's tomb, and is being pursued by wild dogs. As Arnold is climbing, one of the dogs reaches him, biting him, and a crew member runs on-screen to intervene as Arnold shouts \"Goddamnit!\" in pain.",

In the theatrical version, Scott describes his planned evening as \"a titty movie on Skinemax.\" On TBS, he says \"a porno movie on cable.\" Later, Dr. Evil asks Scott if he wants to see what Daddy does for a living. Scott's response is \"Blow me,\" which he follows up with \"Show me\" when Dr. Evil asks him to repeat that. In the TBS version, Scott says \"Bite me,\" which he follows up with \"Might be fun.\" - The line \"I never forget a pussy ... cat\" has been redubbed \"I never forget a kitty ... cat\", which ruins the joke. - Two versions of the \"lifeboat\" alternate ending were broadcast on TBS. In one, Basil arrives hanging from a helicopter. He gives Vanessa her full accreditation as a field agent, and gives Austin the card of a dental specialist.

        "The Serbian DVD version is 160 minutes long and is a significantly different cut from any other DVD or video releases. There is no opening map and narration. The musical score is the original Vladimir Kraus-Rajteric score which kicks in very rarely. The scenes are rearranged so that Welles makes his speech to the troops near the beginning and the air attack hits Bihac simultaneously with the land battle. Almost every dialog scene is lengthened and cut slower than the English version, but there are some parts of the action scenes cut a lot tighter. For instance, this is missing the scene where Riva falls out of the truck during the Italian retreat. It is also missing the scene in the Orthodox church prior the Welles addressing the Chetniks. However, it does feature several new scenes, most notably a scene where Vasco raids a house in Prosor only to then shoot and wound his own commander, and then a second battle between the Partisans and the Italians. In this scene, Riva refuses to fire at his own men and Novak almost shoots him only for Martin to intervene. General Morelli is captured and then promptly commits suicide with a pistol. There is also a new scene where the partisans surprise attack a group of Chetniks guarding the Neretva bridge. There are several more violent shots missing from other prints - such as the Ustashans hanging an old woman and laughing when they march through Bihac. There are several more deaths during the end battle with the Chetniks such as a partisan being shot in the back when reaching for a grenade. Then at the end of the battle there is a scene where a partisan named 'Stipe' goes crazy and guns down a number of Chetnik prisoners, only to have his rank stripped from him. Curiously almost all the nationalities speak their own language; with Riva speaking Italian even with his Yugoslavian captors and Morelli speaking in German when addressing General Lohring. The only actors dubbed appear to be Yul Brynner and Orson Welles.",

(This explains Slide's arrest later in the movie for 37 parking tickets.) - The first scene in the locker room has Lonnie, Hippo and Chuco getting into their work clothes while listing to the radio about a bombing by the Mad Pop Bottle Bomber, and Charlie walks in coughing and Hippo comments on Charlie's cough. - Snapper arriving for work and meeting Earl a.k.a.: Mr. Clean getting out his car and removing a polisher from the trunk. - A scene at Big Joe's Dog House next door to the car wash with Joe (Danny DeVito) arguing with Terry (Brooke Adams) about her looking at another guy while parked at a stoplight on their way to work. - Another scene at Big Joe's with Joe aruguing with Terry about the work they do while planing breakfast for the first customers. - The montage of washing cars has some scenes with Marsha putting on more makeup and hairspray in place of the shots of Irwin smoking pot in the mens room and Goody walking in on him. - The scene where Earl talks to the Oldsmobile owner is extended with Earl offering to polish the man's car and offers $18.50 for the job which will last four hours, and the car owner finally agrees. - A scene where Irwin sees a plate danish pastries and takes one which his father Mr. B, tense and worried about everything, takes it away and chases him away.  While Mr. B is talking to Marsha about an obituarry of a friend dying, Irwin returns and takes the entire plate of danish away to the pinball room to eat them. - A shot of the hooker in the ladies room looking at her self in another fashion with a brunette wig, she decides she does not like it and begins changing into another fashion. - A scene at Big Joe's where Terry is talking to two policemen about her and Joe seeing the movie \"Carrie\" the other night, the mailman Barney arriving with Joe's mail, and Joe telling the policemen that the coffee they are drinking is 70 cents with their dounuts.  One cop balks saying that Terry gives them coffee for free.  Terry is somewhat embarrased and Joe angrilly sweezes a jelly dounut so hard that the jelly splurts out. - More dialouge between the Hysterical Woman outside the ladies room while Scruggs gets her ill son a bucket for him to throw up in. - While Marsha is chating with Lindy outside the ladies room, Terry is handling a customer, and Joe delivers Mr. B's lunch where he asks Joe if the meat is lean. - The first scene of the litharo Kenny is at Big Joe's where he pays Terry for his coffee and kisses her hand much to her shock, Joe sees this and angrilly storms out of the place with Terry following after him. (They are seen in the background by Marsha as she eyes Kenny aproaching her.) - Terry arriving back at the hamburger stand in tears where she is comforted by Maureen the hooker who tells her about her troubles with a man named Joe too. - A scene which comes after T.C. pushes Terry away from the phone booth for him to call and win the radio contest, Terry enters the phone booth after T.C. leaves and calls her mother and asks if Joe is there with her. - A scene where Terry is closing down Big Joe's for the day, Joe returns and as Maureen the hooker watches, he and Terry kiss and make up. - Marsha's storyline ends on a more downbeat note as while waiting for Kenny to pick her up, she says goodbye to Chuco as he board the same flatboard truck with the other Latino workers heading for home, Kenny arrives with his date, a more attractive woman, as well his obnoxious friend Benny as Marsha's date.

Among the highlights are: - A flashback with Frank Lucas and Bumpy Johnson on a boardwalk - A short scene showing Richie Roberts acquiring office space for his new narcotics task force (this added scene follows immediately after Toback assigns Roberts to head up the federal investigation using honest cops of Roberts' choice) - A nighttime scene where Roberts and his team tail a drug pusher with a stash of Blue Magic to an auto body shop; the next morning, Spearman strikes a deal with the shop owner \"Scott\" over the phone, which leads up to Roberts under disguise dropping off $20,000 to get a supply of Blue Magic - In the Bronx, right after Spearman drops off Roberts and informs him that he'll circle the block, an extended scene takes place where Roberts sees both Scott take off in his Jeep and Spearman getting blocked by a broken-down truck, unable to reach Roberts. In desperation, Roberts stops a yellow cab and shows his badge, argues with the uncooperative cabbie to use it, and eventually decks the cabbie in the face to take control of the cab and quickly pursues the escaping drug pusher, ending with Roberts following the unsuspecting Scott on foot. - After the Christmas visit with Charlie Williams, there's an extended scene with Frank and Eva back at their home, where Frank reminisces how Bumpy gradually stayed more and more at home towards the end of his life because of constant police surveillance. He then asks Eva if she wants to go out, nevertheless. - An extended ending in 1991 where Lucas upon release from jail is picked up by Roberts, and the two make their way towards the intersection of 116 St. and Frederick Douglass Blvd, conversing while drinking lattes.",
