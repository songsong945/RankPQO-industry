The Arranged Mode allowed the player to experience the game with different camera angles in some areas, new costumes for the main characters (including Rebecca), different item and enemy placement and a new monster in the game. A later version of Director's Cut, known as the \"Dual Shock version\", contained vibration and analog support for Sony's Dual Shock controller, as well as a new soundtrack composed by Mamoru Samuragoch. The Japanese release included a bonus disc known as the \"Complete Disc\" (in the place of the Biohazard 2 demo), which contained downloadable save data and gameplay footage from the scrapped version of Biohazard 2.",

Shots of this ending are included in the movie storybook. It had Wadsworth as the solo killer of the bunch, explaining that he killed everyone out of the need for perfection in the world, that all of life's consistencies were not good enough, and further tells the six 'victims' that he has poisoned the champagne he served and unless they find an antidote in three hours, they'll die. Police show up soon enough and trap Wadsworth, but not for long. He gets away from the chief and leaves, locking all the people in the mansion. But as he steals a police car, he notices a 'smell' (the dog dropping smell from the beginning of the film) and realizes the Doberman from earlier is now in the police car, and it lunges for him. The police car crashes, and Wadsworth is dead. This implies that the others got out okay now that the windows were not guarded by the Doberman any longer.",

The film sat on a shelf for almost 25 years until actress Lea Lander rescued it from oblivion by helping finance a DVD release: a new short prologue was shot, according to Bava's original script, and editing and scoring were completed using existing available materials.  In 2002 producer Alfredo Leone and director Lamberto Bava (Mario's son), allegedly dissatisfied with the DVD edit, produced a new restored version of the film.  Lamberto Bava and his son Roy shot additional footage and original composer Stelvio Cipriani created a new complete musical score (though the DVD release employed some of Cipriani's cues and themes, the film was never properly scored in 1974).

However, Beethoven chews on the wire, which causes the garage to open. - After George Newton finds out about the puppies, the next scene shows him stapling fliers on each tree saying \"Puppies for sale\", while Emily secretly takes them off one-by-one, then attempts to potty-train them next to a hydrant, but it becomes very difficult for him. - The Newtons were packing all of their belongings and gear into their car before leaving their house. - After the McDonald's scene, the Newtons are singing car songs. - During the stay at their lake house, Ted secretly picks out air fresheners from the local convenience store. - Emily telling her mom that she taught their puppy Tchaikovsky, but he doesn't really follow her at all afterwards. - At Taylor's party, it shows Beethoven struggling to get free from the support beam, with the glass bottles shown shaking frequently. Although the scene where the three party guys are shown pouring beer onto Beethoven is edited out (but not in the final cut of the film). - During The fair scene when George is eating the kids show up to take him to the eating contest with Beethoven,the scene originally ends with George saying \"What kind of a contest is it where you just sit?\" however there is an extended version which shows them walking away with Ted saying \"C'mon Dad\" - After George's nightmare sequence of a lot of puppies in his living room, the Newton family's commercial airs on their TV and they all begin to watch it. The difference here (compared to the final cut of the film) is that once the doorbell rang (after the commercial), Ryce stands up quickly from the couch and answers the door, instead of her shouting, \"I'll get it!\"",

        "There are two slightly different versions of the movie, the difference ocurring at the end. The US version of 'Beyond The Clouds' (Al di l\u00e0 delle nuvole, 1995) lacks the complete voice-over narration by John Malkovich's character at the end of the movie, from the moment he enters the hotel until the last image, before going to credits. The only line heard is: 'The director's profession is very peculiar...'; whereas the European cut of the movie contains a longer narration, also starting with the same line, but expanding until the last image before fading to credits. The voice-over talks about how the director's profession is to find images, only to discover another image beneath the previous one which is more faithful to the truth, and then another, and another, until you reach the one which equals reality, the one no one will ever see. Both versions are equally powerful in their own right, though it's interesting to note such a minor difference was made in the first place. Both versions are available, the US version was released in DVD, and the European version is available in VHS only.",

        "All prints of the original version of \"The Cage\" were destroyed by Paramount sometime in the sixties...or so it was thought. For over two decades, the only surviving copy had been a 16mm black and white proof print personally owned by Gene Roddenberry. Mr. Roddenberry took this proof print with him on the college lecture circuit throughout the 70's and early 80's. As a result of many showings in dilapidated 16mm projectors, it has become badly scratched and damaged. One of the versions available on video is a re-created hybrid of the original, using the B&W proof print as a reference, reconstructed from footage used in the episode \"The Menagerie\" (transferred from the original color camera negatives) and the deleted footage (as originated from the B&W proof print)...this version was originally released on video in the 1980s (and most recently on DVD) with a special introduction by Gene Roddenberry. Then, a few years later, in 1988, a full-color original print of the episode was discovered in the Paramount archives and then released as a filler episode during the original syndication run of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" due to a Hollywood strike (it was later shown during the Sci-Fi Channel's first run of the original \"Star Trek\" series). The original soundtrack to the discovered print was missing, but the re-mixed soundtrack used for the previous hybrid B&W/color version (in which the \"Menagerie\" soundtrack was used wherever possible to avoid using the severely scratched and degraded optical soundtrack from the proof print) was re-synched to this restored full-color version to make it look and sound whole. In any event, the most significant difference in the existing versions of the pilot is the voice of the Keeper. In the numberous restored versions, it switches between that of actor Vic Perrin in the footage taken from \"The Menagerie\" and that of Malachi Throne in the restored footage. This is because, coincidentally, Malachi Throne was cast as Commodore Mendez in \"The Menagerie\". The producers, quite rightly, thought that it would be confusing for Commodore Mendez and The Keeper to have the same voice, so The Keeper's lines were re-dubbed. (All Thelosian characters were played by women with dubbed male voices.) Among the other addtional scenes/differences in the original version-- -Pike discovers a monster lurking in the Talosians' chambers during the Captain's imprisonment; an extended version of Pike's first illusion, set on the planet Rigel VII (referred to earlier in the film by the ship's doctor) -Spock and crew suspect that their weapons are an illusion by the Talosians -extended dialogue by the Keeper about \"Number One\" -an extended illusion scene set in the countryside -an extended version of the Orion Slave Girl sequence -the Enterprise loses power as they are about to escape from Talos, and the computer bank goes out of control (both a result of the Talosians' telepathic powers) -and an extended closing scene aboard the bridge.",

The following changes were made to the film for this release: - The \"In Association with Silver Screen Partners IV\" credit is replaced with \"The Special Edition Of--\" on the opening title sequence. The 2002 DVD omits this credit & the Walt Disney Pictures Presents credit stays on screen. - The animation in some of the scenes went back through the clean-up animation department a second time, to correct problems such as wavering lines and missing details, which, while not very noticeable during a traditional 35mm showing of the film, would have been discomforting on a much large IMAX screen. Small details, such as the blood in Beast's wound after his fight with the wolves, were also added. - The Beast's \"stutter\" (\"You wan-wanna stay in the tower?\"), a sound editing mistake, was corrected (\"You wanna stay in the tower?\"). - Six minutes of new footage was added between the songs \"Something There\" and \"Beauty and the Beast,\" most of which is made up of a new musical sequence, \"Human Again.\" This song was written by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken for the original version of the film, but cut for continuity purposes. After Alan Menken altered the song to make it work for the Broadway stage version of Beauty and the Beast, the song was worked back into the film. - During the \"Human Again\" song sequence, the household objects clean up the Beast's castle, which necessitated having the background artists go back and digitally re-paint the backgrounds for the castle scenes that followed so that the castle was clean. - The animation for Cogsworth's line to the Beast after Belle is freed (\"Yes-yes-yes, but...why?\") was completely re-done, as the directors never liked how the animation looked in the original version. - New sound effects are added to the shot where Belle and Phillippe leave the castle to find Maurice, which are supposed to suggest that the Beast trashes his room in anguish (and also so that the backgrounds from this point on would not have to be repainted). - The longer credits necessitated the addition of an additional passage of score music, the version of the 'Transformation' theme that was cut out of the original film, to the end of the film.",

        "The R2 Special Edition (available on the Alien Quadrology Boxset as well as separately) contains 7 extra minutes of altered and/or extended scenes. As a result, there is a little more character development, but the music has also been re-edited (a bit poorly) in some scenes. Here follows a short description: - The main titles (the distorted shots of the 7 early Ripley clones in the theatrical cut) have been replaced by an alternate opening, which starts with a close-up of a growling alien mouth. As the camera pulls back, it is revealed to be the beak of a fly, that is subsequently squashed by a thumb of a soldier. The soldier uses a straw to blow the fly's blood against a window, which shows that he is actually sitting in a nacell of the Auriga spaceship. The rest of the shot shows the Auriga slowly flying away from camera. - Directly after the chestburster has been surgically removed from Ripley 8, she wakes up from her narcosis, grips the surgeon's arm and breaks it. - In the scene where Ripley is shown drawings of a glove and fruit, directly after Genral Perez, Wren and Gediman leave, the doctor shows Ripley a drawing of a young, blond girl, which seems to trigger an emotional memory in her. - During the meal scene, Ripley repeats Gediman's 'Fiori 16', and he asks her what she remembers. Dr. Wren can also tells some more about the Weyland-Yutani company (\"bought up by Wall-Mart\") - The 'Betty introduction scene has been completely re-edited and extended. The scene now starts with the Betty flying towards the Auriga, Elgyn giving the clearance code over the radio (E-A-T-M-E), but now he flirts some more with Hillard, and warns Call and Vriess over the intercom to get ready. Next, Call and Vriess are shown working on the cargo, followed by some extended dialogue in which Vriess tells Call an obscene joke. This is followed by the scene in which Christie gets his hidden weapons (which came first in the original cut). Next is Johner's 'target practice', Vriess then throws a tool to his head, Call calls him names, but Johner simply replies by asking for his knife. When Vriess comments on his alcoholism, Johner demans his knife back, Call breaks it, Johner threatens her, and there is an extra line from Vriess that he and Cal deserve better company. - During the deal between Elgyn and Perez, Elgyn has some more 'flattering' remarks about Call, thinking Vriess has an eye on her. After Elgyn asks Perez for three days bed and board, Perez agrees under a few conditions (no tresspassing in restricted areas, no trouble, no fighting). - After Purvis shouts \"What's in-f###ing-side me?!?\", Wren answers: \"A parasite! A foreign element!\" After Call says that Purvis can be frozen and operated later, she has another run-in with Johner, followed by Christie agreeing that Purvis comes, but saying he will shoot him if he starts acting funny. - Just before everyone takes a dive through the flooded kitchen, Christie and DiStephano have a short conversation on Christie's weapons ('the disposable kind'), and Call reminds everyone to take a deep breath. - In the chapel, just after Purvis' fake chestburst, there is an extended line from Call, stating she recalibrated ground level, sending the ship into an uninhabited quadrant of Earth, before she mentions time of impact. After Ripley asks if she's the new a##hole model, she replies she couldn't let humanity annihilate itself. Ripley comments that she once tried to save people as well; she remembers a girl that had bad dreams, but she died despite her help, and now she can't even remember her name. After DiStephano enters to take them with him, Ripley asks Call if she dreams, which Call does thanks to neural processors; Ripley says she dreams about the aliens every night, and that she used to be afraid, but not anymore, since it is always worse when she wakes up. - After Johner kissed Vriess for getting them safely through Earth's atmosphere, there is an alternate ending with the Betty landing on Earth. Call warns Ripley for the military that will come looking for her soon. She says someone can get pretty lost on Earth, and asks Ripley what to do. Ripley replies that she doesn't know, since she is a stranger there herself. The camera then goes up, to reveal a post-apocalyptical Paris.",

Most of the scenes involving the sultry seductress and spy Farrah have been completely removed, which makes her role in this version of the story almost inexplicable. Other scenes have been severely truncated or re-shot: There is a scene with Feyd Harkonnen in a bath being pampered by three women. In this version the women are fully clothed. When Princess Corrino seduces Feyd Harkonnen for information, the scene fades out abruptly, implying that the Princess gave herself to Feyd for the information. In uncut version, after extracting the information, the Princess presents a topless Farrah as a gift to Feyd, and during the 'love scene' that ensues, the Princess slips away. Considering that the Princess' virginity is the prize offered to both the male heirs of the Atreides and Harkonnen clans, this clumsy cut significantly changes the story. There is a scene where the Fremen remove their desert camouflage and uniforms, revealing their nakedness to Paul Atreides. It is a symbolic scene, for Paul sees that under their uniforms, the Fremen are people, just like he and his mother.

ABBY: It's all Marty's. - After Marty suggests to the P.I. the \"incinerator\" as a means of destroying the evidence of his proposed murder, the P.I.'s line: \"Sweet Jesus, you're disgusting!\" is deleted. - A couple lines from the landlady showing Abby the studio apartment (mainly assuring her Abby won't be bothered at that location) before she starts yelling at her ex-brother-in-law, are deleted. - As Marty opens his safe to retrieve the bounty money (and swap the photo) his line: \"This is an illicit affair\" has been removed, although he can still be seen mouthing it. - When the P.I. shoots Marty, a couple shots are removed of Marty and the P.I. staring at each other after the gunshot. - When Ray and Abby are discussing \"what happened\", in her studio apartment, and Ray feels cold enough to rise from his seat, the shot of him steadying the walrus piggy-bank is removed and his dialog is heard off-screen to cover this change. - When Abby goes to see Maurice about her concerns, the scene cuts as soon as she enters. In the original version, the scene continues and she is seen inside his place and he pours a drink while assuring her that Marty is not dead, even though she is very worried that he is. Some of the dialog from inside the house is placed over the shot outside Maurice's door before Abby goes in, in the 1998 version. - A new page of credits is added at the end, covering the restoration.",

Allied Artists TV approached Sherman with a request for a color horror movie to add to their package of movies for sale to American TV stations. Adamson responded by filming new scenes that added a zombie and mad doctor subplot, featuring Tommy Kirk, Kent Taylor and Regina Carroll, and the vastly re-edited film was sold to TV as The Man With The Synthetic Brain.

        "SPOILER: The original British Thorn EMI VHS release, when compared to the 2005 Mosaic DVD appears to have many scenes that were not merely edited for censorship but were different takes used in a 'tamer' version. Most obvious is the scene where Patsy introduces Sally to the gang as a potential prostitute. In the original Thorn EMI release she remains fully clothed throughout and when Fallon is asked if he wants to 'check out this piece of merchandise' him and Sally simply walk off screen. In the 2005 DVD Sally undresses in front of the gang at Patsy's insistence and is naked when Fallon approaches her. Another scene that was a different take is when Norris kills Fallon in the woodwork lab. In the Thorn EMI release he simply pushes Fallon back over the saw blade killing him almost instantly. In the 2005 DVD he cuts off Fallon's right arm first, Fallon then staggers upright and THEN Norris pushes him back on the blade. Other scenes cut completely and now reinstated are: - The entire fight with Joo Joo's gang. - The rape scene - Barnyard, Patsy and Drugstore finding Fallon's body - Drugstore's death scene (more close ups of his body) - Norris hitting Barnyard more times on the head with the pipe. - Stegman cutting Diane's breasts before fighting Norris. Also the 2005 DVD has written prologue and epilogue. The prologue states the amount of attacks on staff in US High Schools and states that 'no high school is as bad as Lincoln High....yet'. The epilogue states that 'Andy Norris was never prosecuted as the police couldn't find anyone who actually saw it.",

In the unrated version, it just moves on to Bud's meditation. - An additional scene of conversation between Jerry, Dave and Bud. Dave and Jerry notice the surfboards on Bud's patio and he says that he still surfs every now and then but is more into \"cosmic surfing.\" - A scene where Xena asks Dave what Bud is doing. Dave replies that Bud is meditating, and briefly explains what that is. Dave then introduces the Beach Babes to Uncle Bud. Bud asks if the Beach Babes want to stay for dinner, to which Dave says he's sure they would love it. Xena consider going back to the T-Bird ship, until Luna declares that it is the perfect opportunity for a \"social studies\" project. - A scene showing Bud going into his house to mix up a remedy for Jerry's sunburn. In the unrated version, this scene is missing entirely and just cuts to Bud applying the remedy to Jerry's sunburn. - A scene where Bud unsuccessfully tries to reason with Sally to give him more time to fix up his home. Sally tells Bud that she is angry with him for not marrying him. Sally then calls Hassler to talk about Bud's visit and how he refuses to change his place. Hassler gives Sally some suggestions, which do not fare well with Sally. After the call, we see a woman walk up to Hassler and Hassler asks \"So where were we?\". The woman replies with they were going to get the agrees. Hassler replies with \"Oh, yeah.\" - A scene with Bud's house being condemned. The city official (Played by Lenny Rose, who would later go on to play James T. Renford II in the sequel), tells Bud that he'll work something out for Bud to stay at his place until Monday to get the house fixed. Bud tells the Beach Babes along with Dave, Jerry and Ziggy that he has to run an errand and will be back. Also, the director has an uncredited cameo as a city worker.

In the UK version when Hues lifts up and head-butts a thug the camera pans down the thugs face revealing blood pouring from his mouth. In the US DVD the scene cuts away before the camera reaches his mouth. The DVD is also missing several punches to the next thugs ribs. The thug lying on the bed who gets his arm broken is cut identically in both versions. The scene where Dillon (Don Wilson) enters the dead prostitutes room is cut in the UK version. In the DVD we see a close up shot of the woman lying on the bed which is cut from the UK tape. The scene where the thugs attack Shanna's house is cut on the DVD. The knife wielding thug that attacks Dillon get his arm broken in the UK tape before he is thrown through the table. On the DVD the arm break is missing. The scene where Sweet attacks the two men on the street has been cut for the UK version. We should see Sweet lift up the first thug and head-butt him but this is missing from the UK tape (but surprisingly a photo of that exact scene is printed on the back of the tape). The scene where Sweet kills Dillons partner is cut on both versions. Close up punches to the face have been cut from the UK version. Sweet breaking the mans neck has been cut differently on both versions. In the UK version Sweet grabs the mans head and says 'Time to...' but the remaining dialogue (presumably 'Time to die') is missing and the man is lying on the floor with his neck broken. The DVD is also missing the neck break but all of the 'Time to die' dialogue is also missing. The final martial arts scene in Dillon's apartment has been cut differently in both versions. All scenes showing Nunchaku sticks have been cut from the UK version. Various snippets of martial arts have been cut from both versions. The scene showing Sweet impaled on a sword has been cut from the DVD.

Soon after, Bruce arrives and finds Carl tied to a tree still alive, rather than hanging dead from an overhanging branch. Aside from this, Feng's death is far more graphic showing a pseudo-X-Ray shot of Bruce's index finger buried into Feng's heart. Bruce then pulls his finger out, causing the heart to squirt out blood and then finally finishes off Feng with two fingers stabbing his throat, and Feng spitting out blood. Shortly after Feng falls dead to the ground, Carl runs over to Bruce and says \"Hey man, okay?\". The shot then freeze frames with Bruce and Carl looking off into the horizon with the end of the \"theme\" (Bill Conti's \"The Final Bell\" from Rocky) playing. While unconfirmed, it is likely the upbeat, albeit more violent, ending was used for the limited unrated US release (under the title Kung Fu Avengers) while the downbeat, but cut, ending was used originally for the wide R-rated US release (under the more popular title of Soul Brothers of Kung Fu) as well as the UK release.",

Secondly, when Bishop grabs Newt to stop her sliding out of the airlock during the confrontation with the alien queen, the section of actor Lance Henricksen's torso that could previously be seen poking up through a hole cut in the floor has been digitally removed.",

The two characters then walk back on screen and discuss getting together in this way again. Quagmire suggests going back to her home. The rest of the joke shows only the outside of the Simpsons home as we hear Homer Simpson walk in on the couple.

Last shot immediately cuts to black instead of holding on image. This version is the director's preferred cut and has replaced the first cut. It has assumed the original title of \"American Rural West\"",

The following changes were made to the film for this release: - The \"In Association with Silver Screen Partners IV\" credit is replaced with \"The Special Edition Of--\" on the opening title sequence. The 2002 DVD omits this credit & the Walt Disney Pictures Presents credit stays on screen. - The animation in some of the scenes went back through the clean-up animation department a second time, to correct problems such as wavering lines and missing details, which, while not very noticeable during a traditional 35mm showing of the film, would have been discomforting on a much large IMAX screen. Small details, such as the blood in Beast's wound after his fight with the wolves, were also added. - The Beast's \"stutter\" (\"You wan-wanna stay in the tower?\"), a sound editing mistake, was corrected (\"You wanna stay in the tower?\"). - Six minutes of new footage was added between the songs \"Something There\" and \"Beauty and the Beast,\" most of which is made up of a new musical sequence, \"Human Again.\" This song was written by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken for the original version of the film, but cut for continuity purposes. After Alan Menken altered the song to make it work for the Broadway stage version of Beauty and the Beast, the song was worked back into the film. - During the \"Human Again\" song sequence, the household objects clean up the Beast's castle, which necessitated having the background artists go back and digitally re-paint the backgrounds for the castle scenes that followed so that the castle was clean. - The animation for Cogsworth's line to the Beast after Belle is freed (\"Yes-yes-yes, but...why?\") was completely re-done, as the directors never liked how the animation looked in the original version. - New sound effects are added to the shot where Belle and Phillippe leave the castle to find Maurice, which are supposed to suggest that the Beast trashes his room in anguish (and also so that the backgrounds from this point on would not have to be repainted). - The longer credits necessitated the addition of an additional passage of score music, the version of the 'Transformation' theme that was cut out of the original film, to the end of the film.",

        "In 2007, 'Ridley Scott' (qv) released \"Blade Runner: The Final Cut\", digitally remastered with improved visual and sound effects, and with numerous revisions to the 1992 Director's Cut. The more noticeable differences between The Director's Cut and The Final Cut include: - The overall film has been brightened considerably, revealing previously hidden details in many shots. Additionally, the digital enhancement reveals many heretofore obscured details, such as dirty dishes in Deckard's apartment and a freeway high above Pris as she approaches the Bradbury. - The opening credits have been completely redone, although in the exact same font as in the original film. The noticeable shimmer effect from the theatrical cut and the Director's Cut has been removed. - In the opening shot, the flames shooting up have been re-animated to look more synchronized with the associated light play on the smokestacks. - In the shots of the staring eye, you can briefly see the pupil react to the setting of 2019 L.A. - A couple of shots were trimmed (such as Deckard's intro reading the newspaper). - Additional smoke was added behind the cook when Gaff ('Edward James Olmos' (qv)) and a police officer are talking to Deckard while he is eating at the White Dragon. - All spinner wires have been removed and matte lines erased. - Bryant's ('M. Emmet Walsh' (qv)) line \"I've got four skin jobs walking the streets\" has been improved so it's not obviously an inserted recording. - Bryant says that \"2\" replicants were fried in the electrical field (as opposed to the theatrical release and Director's Cut, where he says only 1 was killed). - Bryant describes Leon's job during the incept tapes scene. - New Cityspeak and other chatter comes over on the police scanner in Gaff's spinner rides both to the police station and the Tyrell building. - The original shot of Roy ('Rutger Hauer' (qv)) in the VidPhone booth that had been recycled from the later confrontation with Tyrell ('Joe Turkel' (qv)) has been digitally altered so that it truly does look like Roy was in the booth. The thumb on his shoulder has also been digitally removed from the shot. - The hotel manager mutters \"Kowalski\" as he opens the door to Leon's ('Brion James (I)' (qv)) room for Deckard and Gaff. - The new Unicorn footage is longer and shows Deckard to be awake during the sequence. This is how Ridley Scott and editor 'Terry Rawlings' (qv) originally conceived of the scene. Deckard is shown staring into space, and there is a cut to the unicorn. The film then cuts back to Deckard and again cuts back to the unicorn, before returning to Deckard once more. The shot of the unicorn which appeared in the Director's Cut has also been recolored, and the sound mix has been completely redone. - The blue grid lines on the Esper machine have been reanimated, to make them look less smooth. - When Deckard finds Zhora lying down in the back room on the photo, the image is now that of 'Joanna Cassidy' (qv); previously, it was clearly someone else. - New footage of the LA streets before Animoid Row and Taffy Lewis's club, including the hockey-masked geisha dancers. - The serial number on the snake scale now matches the Animoid Row lady's dialog. - There is a shot of Deckard asking for directions to Taffy Lewis' from a uniformed policeman. - The lip flap between Deckard and Abdul Ben Hassan has been digitally corrected (using 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv)'s son, Ben, as a stand-in for his mouth movements). - In Zhora's death scene, you can tell it is her the entire time; previously it was obvious that her stunt double, 'Lee Pulford' (qv), was in the shot. Joanna Cassidy's head was digitally superimposed over Pulford's. - Deckard's cut after retiring Zhora was digitally removed (it wasn't supposed to be there until after the fight with Leon). - The marquee inconsistencies on the Million Dollar Theatre have been corrected. - During Roy's confrontation with Tyrell, he says, \"I want more life, father\", as opposed to \"I want more life, fucker\". - When Roy kills Tyrell, the footage is the same as that found in the International Cut, with the additional violence. Additionally, when Roy turns to Sebastian, he says \"I'm sorry, Sebastian. Come. Come\", as he walks towards him. - When Pris ('Daryl Hannah' (qv)) attacks Deckard, she reaches down and grabs him by the nostrils - When Deckard shoots Pris, he shoots 3 times instead of 2. - The two shadows (of Ridley Scott and 'Jordan Cronenweth' (qv)) seen on the wall during the chase sequence have been removed. - When Roy pushes the nail through his hand, there is a shot of the nail coming through the skin on the other side. - When Roy releases the dove, it now flies up into a background that matches 2019 L.A. - The music which plays over the end credits is a newly composed piece by 'Vangelis' (qv); a different version of the 'End Credits' theme as heard in all other cuts. - In the closing credits, 'David L. Snyder' (qv) is now listed as 'David L. Snyder', instead of 'David Snyder'. Additionally, 'Ben Astar' (qv) is now credited for playing the role of Abdul Ben Hassan.",

All the scenes of them entering the Bay, including the reference to \"his charts\" (the missionary's), were cut. They cut all references to the \"flying missionary\" who was a German spy, the scenes with the map and all of it. They also cut the other \"delicate\" passage there, where Hirth tells the captive Canadians that the Eskimos are sub-apes like Negroes, only one step above the Jews, and the ripostes from Johnnie and the Factor. Obviously they didn't want to offend southern segregationists or anti-Semites by showing that Nazis shared their racist views, or leave in any dialogue decrying same.",

Each episode was fully restored visually by Gainax as part of an Evangelion renewal project, cleaning up and slightly lengthening the animation in each episode. Also, the original stereo sound mix for both the Japanese and English language versions were remixed into 5.1 surround sound. Additionally, bits of dialogue in the English language version were rerecorded. Specific examples of this include references Misato makes to \"brain damage\" that are replaced with \"mental contamination\" in order to correct a translation error in the original dub, and the dialogue played over the episode previews was completely redone to fit their revised lengths.",

The Special Edition (1998) has a new score by Christopher Franke (of the regular series), cuts out small bits like the \"zoo scene\" at the beginning, corrects effects like the color of the jumpgate, and adds a few scenes which were cut out: Sinclair deals with a hostage situation in customs involving \"dust\"; Carolyn confronts Delenn about her abstention on the vote; the Takashima and Kyle scene is extended, as is the scene where Sinclair describes the Battle of the Line; there's a new voiceover with Kosh's voice; plus Kyle remarks on what he saw when he opened Kosh's encounter suit and the mystery of Kosh's hand is hinted at (longtime viewers will get it; new viewers will just say, \"huh?\" so the mystery won't be spoiled.)",

Divya follows her in and Evan gets on the bed, setting up the scene when Hank returns. - Evan and Hank sit on the beach, where Evan convinces Hank to become a concierge doctor because it would be wrong to deny health care to anyone based on their income, rich or poor.

The main song adds a scene with a used clothing merchant and another scene where Charlie and Paul play cricket. In the dance, the Caribbean dance now precedes the Irish dance. Unlike the rest of the formerly cut scenes, the tail end of the Irish dance and the beginning of the dance's climax only existed as a faded work-print that had to be digitally scanned and cleaned before it could be brought back to a passable state. - Mr. Browne tells Swinburne that the bed once belonged to royalty and is being offered to the Bookman as a present, while the children push the bed through the door. - Mr. Browne rebuffs the Bookman's offer to swap sections of the book, but relents when he is threatened. - A scene in the village store where Mrs. Hobday meets Mr. Browne and suggests he should marry Miss Price. Mr. Jelk walks in and overhears them. - The song \"Nobody's Problem's for Me\" is reinstated after Mr. Browne leaves the house. No orchestral track existed, so the studio recorded a new one.",
