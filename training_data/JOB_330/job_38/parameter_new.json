It is also available on video. Intended to be a standalone film, the movie version has a new ending that reveals the identity of the killer of Laura Palmer. The film version eliminates most of the supernatural aspects of the series, too, with the exception of a dream sequence at the end. 'Michael J. Anderson' (qv) appears as \"The Man from Another Place\" and 'Frank Silva (I)' (qv) appears as Bob only in this extended version; they were introduced to the series later.",

        "The first R-rated cut to be released (October 1981) cut 51 minutes of footage (much of it for continuity purposes) and contained many alternate angles. It had the following changes: - The opening scene is trimmed; instead of panning from the herd of sheep to Caligula and Drusilla lying on the ground, looking at the leaves, then getting up to chase each other, it's simply a cut from the herd of sheep to Caligula and Drusilla getting up. Later in the scene, they cut back to the herd of sheep to hide the cutting of Caligula sucking Drusilla's breast. The final several seconds of the scene are also cut to avoid exposing Drusilla's genitalia. - The scene following the credits is shortened; it cuts from Drusilla saying \"he's not!\" to Macro entering the room. Several shots are juggled around, and Caligula's line \"Macro!\" is moved to a different shot. The final few seconds of the scene are trimmed, calling for a much quicker dissolve than in the original cut. - The start of the scene in which Caligula is being carried to the palace while nude slaves work on the road is trimmed to avoid showing male genitalia. - The scene by Tiberius's pool includes many alternate angles, juggled shots, and rearranged dialogue to avoid showing male genitalia (and a new laugh is dubbed over at the end as Tiberius exits the pool). - The scene in Tiberius's grotto is almost entirely alternate angles in the segments involving the drunk soldier, and in the pleasure building. As well, many shots and lines of dialogue are juggled around. - The scene in which Caligula expresses his fears of being killed by Tiberius to Drusilla, and where he is frightened by a black bird is cut entirely. - In the \"morning at Capri\" scene, several shots exposing genitalia are cut, as is the brief scene of three senators bathing in red mud, and Caligula's fantasies of torturing people. - The entire scene where Charicles explains the condition of Tiberius to Caligula, and in which Macro swears his allegiance to Caligula is cut. - The \"coronation\" scene is trimmed by excluding a brief moment in which Caligula stops in the middle of his speech to sniff a white object in Drusilla's hand. - The two explicit shots of fellatio behind the moon face in Caligula's bedroom are cut. - The entire scene where Caligula \"judges\" a land dispute is cut. - The entire scene where Caligula banishes Ennia and hears about Macro's sentence is cut. - The Temple of Isis scene is trimmed to remove graphic sex, and is shortened; the scene ends with Caligula saying it is \"perfect\" that Caesonia is the most promiscuous woman in Rome. - The \"killing machine\" scene is trimmed to remove all but one quick shot of decapitation. The shot of Macro being beheaded is replaced with a long shot of the same act. Also, the dissolve between this scene and the next is cut. - The rape of Livia and Proculus is drastically shortened-the scene ends on a close-up of Proculus just after Caligula tells Livia to take off her clothes. - The scene where Caligula does his \"little boots\" dance in the rain is shortened to remove nudity. The sex scene between Drusilla, Caesonia, and Caligula (as well as between Messalina and Agrippina) is cut altogether. - The entire sequence with Caligula getting sick, his recovery, as well as when he signs documents and executes Proculus (then sees the black bird again) is deleted, but the shot of the crowd outside the palace is kept, and used as an establishing shot for the next scene. - The scene where Caesonia gives birth is trimmed to remove the exposure of the infant's head coming through the vagina. - The scene where Caligula licks Drusilla's corpse is parially at an alternate angle. - The shot of Caligula wandering the streets with several women crouching in the background was cut. - The scene where Longinus discusses Caligula's whereabouts with Caesonia is cut. - The jail scene is shortened to remove the giant's coin trick. - The Imperial Bordello scene uses many alternate angles, and deletes all but a few seconds of the Guccione inserts. - The Battle of Britain scene is missing a brief conversation between Chaerea and Caligula. - The Celebration scene is shortened to remove shots of pearls mounted in vaginas, and has the end missing; The scene ends just after Caligula shouts \"EAT!\" - Caligula, Caesonia, Julia, and the giant's death scenes are all trimmed to remove more graphic moments (i.e. Julia's head against the stone, closeups of Caligula being stabbed by the guards, etc).",

Instead, the last we see of him is when he's lying on his back in the burning room and we hear the words of his daughter \"everybody dies\". The camera zooms in on the numbers on the outside door, just as they melt from the heat. The next scene is at Mike's funeral where his coffin is lowered into the ground right next to his daughter's; just as the visions 1408 prophesied. Lily is there, being consoled by Mike's agent. As the procession ends, Lily walks to her car and is met by Gerald Olin who is carrying a box. Gerald introduces himself and gives his condolences. He says the box contains some of Mike's belongings still left in the room. He offers it to Lily while also trying to explain, with a sense of hope, that Mike's death of was not in vain and that because of his actions no one else will *ever be able to stay in room 1408. Lily, in too much grief to listen, cuts him off and refuses to accept the box. Gerald returns to his car and opens the box, which contains the nightgown that was sent through the fax machine as well and the burned tape recorder. Gerald plays it and hears the same dialog between Mike and his daughter heard at the end of the theatrical release. As he listens, he sees a young girl in his rear-view mirror waving in his direction. He turns around to look at her and catches a brief vision of Mike Enslin in his back seat, hideously burned. Gerald jumps but the vision quickly disappears. He looks back at the girl who has found her dad that was looking for her. Gerald catches his breath, starting his car and driving off. The final scene goes back to room 1408. We see a specter Mike Enslin staring out the window. The last shot is of him finishing his cigarette and walking towards the door just as he vanishes.",

        "PART TWO of the extended cut of \"Beauty and the Obese\" starts with a \"Previously on Stripperella\" segment that runs almost two minutes. Other additions/changes include: - 1. The scene with Stripperella undercover at Dr. Cesaerian's as \"Sister Mary Hadalamb\" is extended slightly. The scene in the original ends after a close-up of Stripperella's face and goes to her night break-in of the office. The new stuff begins with Stripperella beating a hasty if clumsy retreat \"Well, I'd better go back to... where-ever nuns go.\" \"Church?\" \"Yeah! That place!\". Then we shift to the front door of the Tender Loins with the sign reading \"Open till 2 am... never clothed.\" We see the Siamese twins confronting the doorman. He reacts with shock, exclaiming \"Whoah! YOu're twice!\" He then rubs his eyes and says \"Now you're all blurry!\" to which the Brit wannabe, Cliff, responds nastily. The doorman asks for ID's, but Dave is the only one with a card and is granted enterance. When he is denied, Cliff complains \"You don't really need to see my ID. I'm clearly over twenty-one.\" Persephone then runs up, excited that Dave arrived, but is less enthused by Cliff's presence. The feeling is mutual as Cliff snarls, \"I return to London in the morning and my brother insisted that we spend my last night in a vulgar sleaze emporium!\", prompting an easperated response from Dave. The scene then moves inside of the club with the Siamese twins entered with Persephone as the bartender and Erotica watch. Erotica bemoans her friend's luck with men that the bartender sums up with the conclusion that she's easy(loose). Erotica corrects this charge with \"lucky\", wishing that she could meet a guy , fall in love, etc. She further mutters \"Sometimes I get so lonely, dancing and fighting crime(this second one catches the bartender's attention), that I just don't have time for a social life.\" The bartender asks about her statement 'fighting crime' that prompts Erotica to hastily say that she said GRIME and that she spends a lot of time cleaning around the house. She then leaves work AGAIN, saying goodbye to her boss. He tries to protest, but she ignores him totally and he gives up. This new addition is about 1 and 1/2 minutes. - 2. As she breaks into Dr. Cesaerian's office that night, some new dialogue inserted. As she cuts a hole into the front door's glass with a clawed glove, she mutters to herself \"Oh, I forgot that I can cut glass with my nipples! I could've broke a nail like this.\" Another dialogue addition happens when she picks the door to Room 3. She mutters, \"Oops, wrong finger.\" The scene is not extended timewise at all. - 3. The next new scene begins in the Tender Loins as the owner and the bartender discuss the 2-drink minimum policy and how it would adhere to the Siamese twins, with the owner asking if they should be charged for 2 or 4 drinks. The bartender says it doesn't matter since the British half has had WAY more than 4 drinks. Totally soused, Cliff suggests that they visit \"your naked tart of a girlfriend!\" Dragging Dave along reluctantly, Cliff drools and giggles mispronouncing Persephone's name and climbing up on the stage. Dave angrily chastises Cliff, and the two get into a fistfight. Confronted by the doorman Cliff is ordered out while Dave is allowed to stay, but Dave says he was leaving anyway. Outside the club, Persephone follows the two and ask to speak to Cliff alone. Dave turns away and Persephone asks what Cliff hates about her, insisting that she's not trying to come between them. Cliff admits that he's jealous of Dave. Since Dave was born first by a week (no, this doesn't make sense to me either or Persephone, seeing as they're Siamese twins)he always felt as if their parents loved Dave more. He then drunkenly rambles on about how while he was at Oxford, Dave was partying with women. This made him jealous because he never had success with women. He also admits that he's madly in love with her and bemoans that she'd probably never give him the time of day, saying mean things to her as a defense mechanism. She softens at that and hugs Cliff. This scene ends with drugged Striperella waking up in the doctor's basement lab and runs about 2 1/2 minutes. - 4. After Dr. Cesearian explains his rationale behind his actions, exclaiming \"Ooh, I HATE models!\" there is a dialogue extension where he continues \",,,and heights. But, that's neither here nor there. You can't really harm heights.\" - 5. In the VH-1 Fashion Awards, the announcer's line-up of stars is slightly different. In the original, ALF and others are mentioned, while the first listed in the two-parter is Tony Danza and others. - 6. When Dr. Cesaerian threatens to inject the now-freed Stripperella with cellulite, there is a new commercial break. After the break, the scene repeats the last line. - 7. There is a change in Kathie Lee Gifford's appearance on the Fashion Awards. In the original, her scene is black-and-white(implying that it's on a TV screen), but in the two-parter, she's announced and her scene is in color. - 8. In the race to the Fashion Awards, there is a slight scene extension. It starts after Woody Allen comes on stage at the Awards. Stripperella pulls up to a railroad crossing on her bike just as the barrier comes down and the train crosses. As she waits, a truck from \"Ramps Plus\" pulls up next to her with a huge ramp attached behind the trailer. She uses this to jump the train. As she lands on the other side, the train passes and the barrier goes up, exasperating her. This extension runs about 40 seconds. - 9. In the original concluding scene at the Tender Loins, a slight dialogue extension has Persephone bemoaning that Dave left her because she slept with his brother Cliff and somehow he found out. This lasts about 25 seconds. - 10. After the bartender muses \"I have a feeling we haven't seen the last of Stripperella.\" the original episode ends, but in the two-parter there is an extension showing Erotica backstage pulling the bag of Dr. Cesaerian's face parts (all that was left of him after his lab mysteriously exploded)out of her pocket and saying, \"I don't think we've seen the last of YOU, Dr. Cesaerian.\" The scene then shifts to a train station where we see an extremely fat and trench-coated figure boards a train to Italy. It is Dr. Cesaerian, and he literally sneezes his nose off before replacing it and boarding the train. - 11. The words \"The End\" are actually shown before the credits. - PART TWO runs about 21 and 1/2 minutes, with commercials excised. The whole thing runs about 43 and 1/2 minutes total.",

Shots of this ending are included in the movie storybook. It had Wadsworth as the solo killer of the bunch, explaining that he killed everyone out of the need for perfection in the world, that all of life's consistencies were not good enough, and further tells the six 'victims' that he has poisoned the champagne he served and unless they find an antidote in three hours, they'll die. Police show up soon enough and trap Wadsworth, but not for long. He gets away from the chief and leaves, locking all the people in the mansion. But as he steals a police car, he notices a 'smell' (the dog dropping smell from the beginning of the film) and realizes the Doberman from earlier is now in the police car, and it lunges for him. The police car crashes, and Wadsworth is dead. This implies that the others got out okay now that the windows were not guarded by the Doberman any longer.",

        "There is much incorrect and misleading information concerning the various versions of this film. In America, only three versions have been made available publicly (either for video or theatrical release): - The \"uncut, uncensored, and unrated\" cut. This was first released in theaters in February, 1980 with a running time of 156 minutes. When it was released on video, CED and laserdisc in January of 1984, the film was time compressed down to 148 minutes (though the laserdisc mistakenly states on the cover that the film is 143 minutes). This version was released again on video and laserdisc in 1989, still at 148 minutes from time compression. In 1999, it was re-released in theaters and on DVD back at 156 minutes, without time compression. - The first \"R\" rated version. This was first released in October of 1981 after it seemed unlikely that the film could make its money back in an X rated form. This version ran for 105 minutes, featured many alternate angles, and cut many scenes for the purpose of continuity and pacing. This version was released on video, CED, and laserdisc in January of 1981, time compressed to 101 minutes (and with an afterword in which Bob Guccione encourages the viewer to return the R version and purchase the unrated version via the postal service). This version has not been in release in the United States since. - The second \"R\" rated version. This version was released on DVD in 1999, and used no alternate angles; the film was sloppily cut from the aforementioned unrated version. However, because it eliminates many dramatic scenes that the 1981 R-rated version also eliminates, it appears to have been modeled after the previous R-rated version. However, unlike with the 1981 edit, alternate material was not available, so the (uncredited) editor simply repeated several shots to cover up gaps in the film. This caused for enormous lapses in continuity during some of the most graphic scenes (especially in Tiberius's grotto). This version runs 102 minutes.",

To fit the existing color footage to the uncut soundtrack, some shots are repeated. - Before Pike's line \"Don't help me. . . They can't read through hate\", the Keeper exits the menagerie. After that line, a shot from a later scene of the Keeper returning is re-used. This was made to cover up the dissolve to the later scene that was made for \"The Menagerie\" (1966). Originally, this shot followed a closeup to Veena, a cut to the Enterprise bridge, and a cut to the prisoners asleep in the cage. All of that was ruined (maybe permanently) by the dissolve made in 1966. - After Pike beams back to the ship, there is a reaction shot of Number One and Spock. The color print of this shot was lost, so what is used instead is a re-photographed shot of the shot played on the view screen (taken from \"The Menegerie, part II\").

        "The differences as shown in the elongated TV version [indicated from a 1999 November showing on the Sci-Fi channel] are: - 1. Darkman (Arnold Vosloo) is introduced in the film immediately before the car chase; watching it from above. He then slides down a rope in front of a neon-lit sign. In a series of crosscutting, the car chase ensues as Darkman runs on rooftops. In the DVD/VHS version, Darkman is not introduced until after the car chase ends when the character Steve is shot; followed by a woman's scream. The shot of Darkman swinging down is never featured. The crosscutting of Darkman running only occurs as a gunman flees from the car wrecks. The TV version also features a shot of the policemen apprehending the immobilized gunman after Darkman's remark: \"Thanks for the donation.\" This single shot is absent from the DVD/VHS. - 2. After the scene where Peyton Westlake and Dr. David Brinkman (Jesse Collins) agree to be partners, Brinkman is seen waving off to a jetting Westlake replying solemnly, \"Partners...\" Directly afterward, a wide establishing tracking shot of Westlake's lab is featured. It then cuts to a medium shot of Westlake silently switching on a remote control. A radio is heard during these two shots reporting the weather. In the DVD/VHS version, none of this included. As Westlake jets out of Brinkman's lab, it cuts directly to a shot of Westlake's remote camera running across the floor with Westlake already at the controls. - 3. Westlake, once again in his lab, becomes enraged after reminiscing about what Dr. David Brinkman said to him before his murder. He screams savagely knocking objects off his desk, and then proceeds to run around his lab destroying additional objects. He is then interrupted by the TV's broadcast stating the name, \"Robert Durant...\" which features the character Jill Randall (Kim Delaney) and her live report. This then gives the motivation for Westlake to meet her. In the DVD/VHS version, this bit where he is interrupted by the TV is missing. - 4. When Westlake is confronted by Jill at the post office, the scene ends with a shot of her walking out the door and him in a close up holding up his scarred hands and then putting them to his face. This shot is missing in the DVD/VHS version. - 5. Before the scene where the character Eddie (David Ferry) is knocked out in the bathroom, a medium shot on a street corner shows Eddie stopping to look at his watch, and then him proceeding across the street with a silver briefcase. The shot eventually tilts up to reveal a large office building. In the DVD/VHS version, an exterior shot at the same street corner features the building, but no Eddie at all. It is a different shot because the traffic is not the same. - 6. When Darkman salutes Jill's photo seen on a TV in a store window, a shot shows him walk off with his cart further down to darker parts of the street as Randy Miller's musical score intensifies. The narration starts as the shot dissolves to a silhouette of Darkman looking out towards the city. In the DVD/VHS version, the narration starts at the shot of Darkman saluting, which then dissolves directly to the silhouette. - NOTE: Ordinarily, the intensely violent moments of the film are also removed to fit TV standards [depending on what that particular network allows].",

The 2007 release by Allumination Filmworks has a total running time of 50:03 (including 00:30 of production clips) and was probably shortened for release on commercial television in an hour long time slot. Both DVDs list a running time of \"approximately 60 minutes\". The Allumination version was created by cutting 05:51 out of the Bonneville feature; the longest cut (02:42) begins in the \"Twinkie\" scene when Jess promises May Belle that he will get even with Janice Avery for eating May Belle's Twinkie, continuing through Leslie and Jess forging a letter to Janice from Willard Hughes, through Jess putting the letter in Janice's desk, through Jess seeing puppies being given away for free, through Leslie telling Jess that Janice is in the bathroom crying, and stopping just before Leslie tells Jess why Janice is crying. The shortest of the 13 cuts is 4 seconds. Noticeable cuts include: (after May Belle tells Jess she followed him and Leslie) Jess threatening May Belle (\"I catch you following me and your life ain't worth nothin'.\" and \"I'll tell Billie Jean Edwards you still wet your bed.\"); after Jess enters Miss Edmunds' red sports car and Miss Edmunds says \"I'm so glad your mom let you come today\", Jess' response, \"Oh!

A shot of a cutting torch being picked up just after the main logo is missing. Two Face's reply after the guard says \"You said you'd let me live\" is missing. After the 'punctual funeral' line, Two Face shouting \"Kill the Bat!\" has been removed from the soundtrack and replaced with music and guards grunting. When the elevator dings just before Batman exits, Two Face's shout of \"Blast him!\" was not present in the UK version. The fight outside the elevator has lost a lot of sound effects, as well as a sequence where Batman drops his leg sharply onto a thug's chest, complete with a loud thud. Batman delivering a backward head butt and breaking a thug's nose in extreme close-up has been removed. Close-ups of kicks to midriffs and faces are also missing. Two Face's lines in the helicopter about the acid have been removed. In the sequence where the helicopter pilot is killed, Two Face emptying an entire clip into the helicopter pilot has been trimmed, along with shots showing the bullets riddling the pilot's body from the front. The cut UK version had only three shots fired, and the pilot is shown slumping from behind. The death of Stickley does not show him stopping on the window ledge, and hanging in terror, before Nygma runs over and says \"Fred, babe! You are fired! Or should I say...terminated?\". With this, he pulls the hat off him and he falls down, but this was all cut from the UK print. Two Face's line in the circus big top was cut from the UK version, \"Our new act for your personal amazement: we call it - Massacre Under The Big Top!\". A shot of Nygma laughing at the above line is also missing. When the Mayor asks what Two Face wants at the circus, his reply is shortened from \"Batman - bruised, broken, bleeding. In a word, dead!\" to simply \"Batman\". The UK version is missing the sequence where Bruce Wayne kills one guard on the right side of the big drum by coming up behind him, breaking his neck, and smacking him in the face as he falls. When Two Face flips his coin before killing the Graysons, after his evil laugh he goes on to say \"Their kind of day\", which was missing in the UK version. As the bomb is raised through the roof of the circus, a quick sequence of Bruce flipping a guard over and kicking him hard in the gut is missing. When Two Face accidentally kills two of his men in the car, their screams have been cut short in the UK version, and a shot of the driver's terrified face has been removed. The fight at Nygma's party loses some impact sounds. Shortly after this, Batman makes a guard do the splits and another crack accompanies this, but the sound has virtually been eliminated from the soundtrack. A small crack has been greatly reduced in volume as Batman twists a thug's arm backwards Robin throwing Two Face a vicious head butts after the line, \"This is for me!\" has been replaced in the UK version, by removing the punch Robin throws after he says \"This is for my brother\" and reinserting in place of the head butt.",

Fred sets the milk bottles out for the milkman, then puts the cat out, who, instead of sneaking back into the house and putting *Fred* out as in the more familiar version, simply slips back into the house and locks the door before Fred can get in. Fred starts pounding on the door, screaming \"Wilma!\" \"Wilma, open this door,\" louder and louder as he does, causing all those lights that went out around town to all come back one again, one by one.

        "The film was originally screened at about 170 minutes. When it was initially released on North American home video in the 1980s, it was trimmed to a mere 141 minutes. Most of the cuts involved was seen as \"unnecessary\" battle footage, such as when Guffy's tanks arrive in the first major battle scene to back up Major Wolenski's battalion and, later, portions of the German day attack on Ambleve are missing, among other scenes. The 1990 video and subsequent home video and laserdisc releases run 156 minutes (in order to market the film on a T-160 videotape) and restore the original Overture, Intermission and Exit Music. Four key scenes are still missing: - 1. Colonel Hessler and General Kohler meet Schumacher's paratroop contingent just after they leave Kohler's office. - 2. After Kohler shows Hessler the colossal war room, Hessler goes outside and inspects his tanks. - 3. After Pritchard tells Kiley he is being transferred to the United States, Kiley and Maj. Wolenski discuss what should be done with Germany after the war. - 4. The most famous missing scene occurs right after the nuns ask Hessler for aid in Ambleve. It has a young French boy attempt to assassinate Hessler. Hessler allows the boy to live, but has his father shot instead. Immediately after this scene, Major Wolenski has a meeting with Hessler in which he confronts him about the Malmedy Massacre.",

        "Some of the main differences between the 20th Century Fox aka theatrical version and Studio Canal aka unrated version are as follows: - The opening sequence monologue of Toorop is different. The narration in the unrated version matches the cyberpunk tone of the movie and denounces God. - The unrated version follows with a sequence of Toorop waking up in his flat and having breakfast before he sets out to the rainy street, which is where the theatrical version starts. - On the train to Vladivostok the unrated version includes a scene of an encounter with a herdsman's family from whom Toorop tries to buy-off their seats. - In the Vladivostok club all the sequences of Aurora's encounters with the fighter are edited differently. The unrated edition employs more close-ups to establish the connection between them, whereas the theatrical version uses mainly wide shots. - The fight between Toorop and the fighter is also edited differently. The unrated version has more shots of Toorop hitting the fighter to fit better with his not so much of a clear-cut hero image. - The snowmobile chase is different in the two versions. The theatrical version features more spectacular stunt shots and shows Toorop more as an unbeatable action hero. - Before the sequence in the tent where they all enjoy the food, the unrated version features a shot of Toorop shooting a cute rabbit. The theatrical version does not explain where they got the meat. - The unrated version follows the shower scene in the Canadian motel with the scene of the High Priestess undergoing plastic surgery which was included in the theatrical version at the beginning after the group left the monastery (in the unrated version after this scene follows a montage of wide shots of the car cruising the landscape). The unrated edition omits the whole sequence on the Canadian airport. - The sequence of Toorop's memory scanning in the unrated version is much longer, revealing his whole past and his terrorist activities, including 9/11. After the scanning the unrated version includes a dialogue scene with Toorop and Darquandier elaborating on Aurora's babies and the next step of mankind's evolution. The scene concludes with Darquandier's troops informing them about the short arrival of the High Priestess (this part is included in the theatrical version after the death of Gorsky). - The unrated version omits the climatic action sequence with the Hummer chase and also the kitschy happy ending with Toorop and the two babies. The unrated version ends with Toorop's narration after his reunion with Aurora and than follows with a much longer scene in the hospital. This ending is true to the spirit of cyberpunk. - Also many tracking shots in the film are significantly longer in the unrated edition, making it more focused on the society and the world of the future in comparison to the action-oriented theatrical version.",

They have to pass through a metal detector in order to gain entrance, and Ida's present to Sam (one of the \"Executive Decision Makers\", seen later in the movie) sets off the alarm. - Part of the beginning of the first \"Samurai\" dream sequence, where Sam explores through the concrete labyrinth he finds himself in.

Jill has taken off the wig she was wearing in the scene before, and has a pink bow tied around her naked body. She says to Sam: \"Something for an executive?\" and he unties her. - The \"Interrogation\" scene, where Sam is charged with all of the violations of the law he committed throughout the film, including \"wasting Ministry time and paper.\" - The \"Father Christmas\" scene where Helpmann visits Sam after his booking, Helpmann is dressed as Santa Claus. Among other things, Helpmann informs Sam that Jill Layton has been killed... twice. - The European release begins abruptly with the 'Central Services' advert about ducts, and ends with a held shot of Lowry in the cooling tower.

After its second post-premiere - the very next day - two scenes of 15 minutes total were deleted; making the film run its original world debut length at 181 minutes. One was a number called \"When My Sugar Walks Down the Street\" that came after Judy's take of \"I'll Get By\" in the 'Born in the Truck' sequence, the other was a scene where Garland and James Mason's characters (Vicki and Norman) were picnicking on the beach; production stills and promotional advertisements are the only thing left in existence of the footage. After its world premiere on September 29, 1954, 27 minutes was cut, bringing it down to a mediocre 154 time length. Those scenes were: 1) Esther quitting the band 2) The Trinidad Coconut Oil Shampoo 3) Esther working at a drive-in 4) Norman being driven away drunk in his car 5) Norman inquiring Esther's old landlady 6) Spotting Esther on the TV commercial 7) Tracking down Esther at her new boarding residence 8) Driving down the strip - Esther getting sick 9. \"Here's What I'm Here For\" musical number - Norman proposes 10. \"Lose That Long Face\" musical number - Vicki breaks down",

One of the men makes a comment about her breasts. - This version shows several of the submariners leaving their families, including Lt. Ince (Viggo Mortensen) saluting his son (played by his real son), Marichek, and others. - Interspersed with the previous extended leaving scene is the submarine movie trivia game on the bus with a few added lines about an invalid question and one owing the other money. - Hunter's jogging scene before the fire is slightly extended. - After the drill, in the Captains cabin, Ramsey asks Hunter to speak to COB about his weight, stating a personal aversion to doing it because they've served together so long. He then makes the 'WWIII, ship being sunk, giant octopus\" statement. - Just before encountering the Akula for the first time while getting an EAM, COB reports to Hunter's cabin while Hunter is shaving. Hunter says that the subject is uncomfortable. COB, almost jovial, says he knows he's overweight, but this is his last patrol and he can't stop eating. They laugh. COB tells Hunter that he thinks Hunter and Ramsey merely have a difference of management styles. Then they go get something to eat. - Just before the Akula launches torpedoes after the winch noise, a comment is made that the Akula is 'range gating' and the sonar tech asks 'What is range gating?' and another says 'It means they have their torpedoes locked on us, stupid!' - During the explosion of the second torpedo (while Ramsey is still in command), an additional shot of a crewman falling down a ladder is added. - We see Rivetti leave sonar, saying 'I've gotta take a whiz' when he goes to release Hunter. - We see COB going into the Naval Inquiry, with Zimmer leaving very upset. COB then leaves, head down. Next, Ramsey is called into the inquiry. All the while we see Hunter waiting. Then he is called in. - The Admiral asks Hunter if he thinks his recollection of the events differs from his Captain's, just before saying 'I have known Capt Ramsey'... etc. - Although the overall score is intact, several scenes had different arrangements.",

        "The Serbian DVD version is 160 minutes long and is a significantly different cut from any other DVD or video releases. There is no opening map and narration. The musical score is the original Vladimir Kraus-Rajteric score which kicks in very rarely. The scenes are rearranged so that Welles makes his speech to the troops near the beginning and the air attack hits Bihac simultaneously with the land battle. Almost every dialog scene is lengthened and cut slower than the English version, but there are some parts of the action scenes cut a lot tighter. For instance, this is missing the scene where Riva falls out of the truck during the Italian retreat. It is also missing the scene in the Orthodox church prior the Welles addressing the Chetniks. However, it does feature several new scenes, most notably a scene where Vasco raids a house in Prosor only to then shoot and wound his own commander, and then a second battle between the Partisans and the Italians. In this scene, Riva refuses to fire at his own men and Novak almost shoots him only for Martin to intervene. General Morelli is captured and then promptly commits suicide with a pistol. There is also a new scene where the partisans surprise attack a group of Chetniks guarding the Neretva bridge. There are several more violent shots missing from other prints - such as the Ustashans hanging an old woman and laughing when they march through Bihac. There are several more deaths during the end battle with the Chetniks such as a partisan being shot in the back when reaching for a grenade. Then at the end of the battle there is a scene where a partisan named 'Stipe' goes crazy and guns down a number of Chetnik prisoners, only to have his rank stripped from him. Curiously almost all the nationalities speak their own language; with Riva speaking Italian even with his Yugoslavian captors and Morelli speaking in German when addressing General Lohring. The only actors dubbed appear to be Yul Brynner and Orson Welles.",

The following changes were made to the film for this release: - The \"In Association with Silver Screen Partners IV\" credit is replaced with \"The Special Edition Of--\" on the opening title sequence. The 2002 DVD omits this credit & the Walt Disney Pictures Presents credit stays on screen. - The animation in some of the scenes went back through the clean-up animation department a second time, to correct problems such as wavering lines and missing details, which, while not very noticeable during a traditional 35mm showing of the film, would have been discomforting on a much large IMAX screen. Small details, such as the blood in Beast's wound after his fight with the wolves, were also added. - The Beast's \"stutter\" (\"You wan-wanna stay in the tower?\"), a sound editing mistake, was corrected (\"You wanna stay in the tower?\"). - Six minutes of new footage was added between the songs \"Something There\" and \"Beauty and the Beast,\" most of which is made up of a new musical sequence, \"Human Again.\" This song was written by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken for the original version of the film, but cut for continuity purposes. After Alan Menken altered the song to make it work for the Broadway stage version of Beauty and the Beast, the song was worked back into the film. - During the \"Human Again\" song sequence, the household objects clean up the Beast's castle, which necessitated having the background artists go back and digitally re-paint the backgrounds for the castle scenes that followed so that the castle was clean. - The animation for Cogsworth's line to the Beast after Belle is freed (\"Yes-yes-yes, but...why?\") was completely re-done, as the directors never liked how the animation looked in the original version. - New sound effects are added to the shot where Belle and Phillippe leave the castle to find Maurice, which are supposed to suggest that the Beast trashes his room in anguish (and also so that the backgrounds from this point on would not have to be repainted). - The longer credits necessitated the addition of an additional passage of score music, the version of the 'Transformation' theme that was cut out of the original film, to the end of the film.",

Starting in 1992, the Sci-Fi Channel aired prints with a third version, with a blue-tinted point of view from a camera roaming through a 1950s-era house. The Sci-Fi prints also added short teasers before the credits (excerpts from the episode) and the episode titles, as well as modified closing credits with still shots of the house for a background, all tinted blue.

In the second version, the footage is replaced with Mike, Nicki and Carter betting on the Super Bowl. - The second version's press conference sequence replaces Ashley's lines with those of a different reporter's. - The original version has a sequence in which Ashley talks with Mike while walking down the hallway.  In the second version, she's replaced with Stuart. - The original version contains a sequence where Mike and Ashley are in their apartment watching television, followed by a closing sequence where they make out off camera.  In the second version, all of the footage is replaced with a completely different storyline in which Nicki and Carter interview a guy named \"Guy\" at a focus group meeting, whom both Nicki and Carter develop feelings for.

This version is available as a bootleg. A full list of scenes cut are: - The scene where they are in the shop in the beginning is removed from the \"uncut\" version and is replaced with an extended scene of them driving the truck through the woods. Then they stop when Burt says he left something back at the store and they have a longer conversation about the map. - The scene of Rider Strong going behind the building to wash his hands after Dennis's bite and he pets the stray dogs is removed from the \"uncut\" version. - A different angle of Jordan Ladd's character Karen swimming away after the \"kiss\" scene on the dock with Rider Strong. - When it is discovered that Karen has the disease during an intimate scene, there is an additional scene that follows the \"Don't...Leave...Me!\" where Burt comes into the room and yells at her about how the truck isn't ready yet, and they have to finish cleaning up the bum's blood. - An extended scene of everyone arguing around the fireplace when Burt makes a joke about his burnt marshmallow. - A scene of Burt sitting outside guarding the shed with his shot gun. This immediatly follows when they hear the dog trying to get Karen in the shed and they shoot a bullet and tell Karen that they will stay outside with her to keep the dog away. - The gunshot to Burt's head in the cabin is bloodier. In the \"R\" rated version it cuts away quick and only shows the aftermath from a difficult-to-see angle. - An additional scene where Rider Strong grabs the long-haired hick after the attack and drags him down to the celler. He yells at the hick as he throws him down there and says \"When they get here, tell them I didn't do it!\", then slams the door. - The human-bonfire scene when they say \"We got another one in the basement\" immediatly goes to a shot of the celler door opening from the inside, then a bunch of shotguns appear and start shooting like crazy. We see blood all over the walls. Then they pour gasoline and one cop lights a match and celler goes up in flames followed by more shots of blood and guts on the walls, ceiling, and floor. - The end is switched around a little. Instead of just the cops drinking the contaminated lemonade followed by a country song with the townspeople, the whole entie town shows up and has a cup. There is additional dialoug amoung the townspeople, different shots, and it shows the FDA man walking around more testing and the Water supply truck is in view longer. - That is every scene that is changed or cut from the Lions Gate release.",

        "There is at least one slightly different version of the movie, issued in Europe on homevideo. The beginning is different - shorter - and introduces Harold Abrahams while playing cricket with his colleagues. The scene in the train station, where Monty meets Harold is absent, as well as the loading of the baggage in the taxi they share. We simply see Monty writing a letter to his parents, mentioning that \"Harold is as intense as ever\" (cut to the cricket scene, maybe 30 seconds long), and then continues with \"I remember our first day... we shared a taxi together\" (cut to the two students unloading their stuff from the car). This alternate version also have slightly different end credits, and does not mention Harold marrying Sybil. The differences are minor (the U.S. version provides a more shocking memento of WWI, when it shows crippled baggage handlers in the station); one of the reasons the cricket scene was dropped in favour  of the station one was due to the distributor's worry that the American  market would not understand it.",

Bennett's death was also trimmed to remove focus on his suffering. The 2001 UK DVD release retained these cuts and also added a further 44 seconds of distributor cuts. This was because the DVD master used for the UK release was a censored German cut. All cuts were fully waived in 2007 by the BBFC. The heavily edited 2001 UK version, with a total of 56 seconds removed, was also used as the master for the initial Australian DVD release. In this version additional edits include: - In the opening scene, after Cooke ('Bill Duke (I)' (qv)) has initially shot the man in the robe, he walks over to the body and shoots him again. This second hit has been removed. - When Matrix breaks Henriques' ('Charles Meshack' (qv)) neck on the plane, he simply elbows him, and in the next shot, Henrqiues is already dead. The shot of Matrix snapping Henriques neck is gone. - The shot of the piece of wood sticking through Cooke's stomach is absent. - All close ups of the pole in Bennett's ('Vernon Wells (I)' (qv)) stomach are gone.",

Esteban's run in the city to the tavern is shorter, but an additional overhead shot is shown. The scene in which Pedro and Sancho are telling the story about the city of gold is shortened (they don't talk about how the patrons of the bar should invest in their adventure.) There is an additional scene of Esteban looking shocked when the official says \"find him and you'll receive a whole piece of gold.\" There is a scene difference in when Mendoza is waiting for Esteban at the dock, he waits longer, but Esteban's run to meet him is shorter. The ending of Episode 1 is omitted in that Esteban discovers Zia only. The scene in which Mendoza smiles at the discovery that Esteban makes of Zia, and the both looking to see the clouds turn into the winged serpent forshadowing things to come is not there. - Episode 2: The daydreaming scene in which the golden butterflies turns into the city of gold is omitted, as well as the daydreaming scene in which Esteban is seasick and floating above the mayan ruins. - Episode 3: The daydreaming scene of the seamonster eating the ship is omitted. - Episode 4: Has the longest runtime of all the episodes of the series contains many additions, cuts, and an alternate ending. Additions include Extended footage of Mendoza rescuing the children with Esteban grabbing onto him through the bars so he doesn't get sucked out, followed by Dialogue of Gomez on the deck of the ship saying something about Gaspard. Gomez then slides down the deck of the ship and gets into the boat. There is a scene added in which Pedro and Sancho wake up in each others arms on the deck of the Esperanza when Esteban calls to Mendoza about the St. Elmos fire. There is also an extended scene after the shark attack where Pedro and Sancho say something off camera, and goes into an on camera dialogue with Esteban and Zia's dialogue about Esteban's father. - Omitted scene: There is a small scene of the raft sitting still in the sunlight. - Alternate Ending: Once the Island is discovered our heroes merely paddle their way toward the island, seeing shots of the lizards, and shots of the island. The Episode ends right here, and the entire footage in the English/French versions of Mendoza swimming from the sharks is gone. - Some of the scenes from Episode 4 alternate ending and the rescue can be seen in the English/French version Previous and To Follow segments - Episode 5: This starts where the English/French Episode 4 ends at the raft on the island. There is a scene omission of Zia lifting her dress to sit down. This Episode ends right where Tao points the crossbow at Esteban. - Episode 6: Starts in the tree house right where Episode 5 left off, and has a small scene of Mendoza Pedro and Sancho arriving on the raft. From this point forward all Episodes are in Synch with the English/French versions, with very few differences. - Episode 9: Starts with an additional second of footage zoomed in on the Solaris's sail - Episode 27: Has a second of footage containing a lightning bolt omitted at the start of the Episode - Episode 29: In the Japanese version when Esteban Tao and Zia are struck by the Olmec ray, Esteban spins around much slower and the background isn't changed as much. - Closing Credits: There is an additional bit of animation used of the sun and then transitioning to Esteban's face - None of the previous, to follows, or live action documentaries are on the Japanese DVD's",

This version appears on the Region 2 DVD. - Syndicated version - Removes several scenes (including a subplot with Judy Landers) to make room for extra commercials, and the flashback audio is partially re-recorded with the \"new\" Alf voice. - Region 1 DVD version - A bizarre hybrid which uses the re-dubbed flashbacks and restores the footage deleted from the original broadcast...

        "In order to receive a PG-13 rating a number of scenes where deleted altogether from the final print. The missing scenes are: - All of the scenes involving a character called the Crying Drunk Girl (Jennifer Elise Cox) who is so drunk that she has subtitles for when she speaks and she is the key to what is going on in movie. Her missing scenes of dialogue are: - After Preston and Denise talk with the Yearbook Girl, the Crying Drunk Girl walks up to them and says, \"Thush bezt weveram sisu gizem chext ear.\" (subtitle translation: \"This is the best party ever! I'm gonna miss you guys next year!) She group hugs them and walks away where Preston says, \"There's one at every party.\" - After Preston walks away from the Exchange Student at the backyard pool, the Crying Drunk Girl walks over to the Exchange Student and says to him, \"Idlik tach yre enis!\" (I'd like to touch your penis!) - When Kenny and Denise suddenly get locked in the upstairs bathroom and scream \"NOOOOO!!!\" the tracking shot from the bathroom door leads down the steps directly to the Crying Drunk Girl who somehow hears them and she says \"Yerd dum shelling yers chairs.\" (Did anyone hear that? Somebody's yelling for help upstairs!) But since no one can understand her, no help comes to Kenny or Denise. - When Amanda is talking to the Stoned Guy and the Watermelon Guy about who Preston is, the Crying Drunk Girl stumbles over to Amanda, leans on her shoulder, and says: \"Snow stun shy is shy sumber shess sing.\" (I know who Preston Meyers is. I can give you his phone number, his address, anything.) Unable to understand her, Amanda just shrugs her off and walks away. - During the police raid, one of the cops is talking to the Crying Drunk Girl on the front lawn of the house who asks her to stop crying and speak clearly and she says, \"I allred tdya, mnwans is mray hunds, ive at seveithg nolfok. (But I already told you! My name is Mary Hampson and I live and 1781 Norfolk!) Unable to understand her, the cop puts in her in a police van with Kenny's two Homboys and others who include the Hippy Girl, the Headbanger and others. - Also deleted was the scene involving the Stoned Girl (Amber Benson) who is glimpsed holding a banana as William walks through the kitchen to taste his first beer. It takes place in between the scenes where Kenny hits on Ashley and Jana where he sees her leaning against a dining room shelf and talks to her, but all she says is \"Okay\" everything he says. Then another girl walks in and thanks Kenny for finding her and says that Stephanie (the name of the Stoned Girl) just took three thingies of herbal ecstasy is so out of it. The girlfriend helps the Stoned Girl to her feet and they leave, leaving Kenny alone and downbeat. - Also deleted was the original opening which takes place in a bookstore the day before the graduation where Preston is talking to Denise about his desire for Amanda and his plans for going away to college. - When Kenny and his two homeboys first arrive at the party, Kenny plays around with a large sheepdog, named Mr. Tuxford, at the front door who belongs to the Girl Whose Party It Is, who jumps onto Kenny licking his face where he pushes the dog away who runs out the front door and the Girl runs after him. - There is more dialogue after when Kenny and Denise are released from the upstairs bathroom where the Girl Whose Party It Is continues yelling at Kenny and about the destruction they brought to her house as they are walking down the stairs where the house is now completely deserted and ransacked, and then the Girl's dog runs into the house and she drops to one knee and hugs the dog while Kenny takes this distraction to walk out and follow Denise. - A scene where the Watermelon Guy holds up a large watermelon and says \"This was in my freezer since September and I've poured six bottles of vodka into it and I've been saving it for this time!\" When all the guys around him grab at it, the watermelon falls on the kitchen floor splattering. - A scene in the \"make-out room\" where Mike Dexter enters looking for Amanda in the basement lit with dim red light and he turns on the basement lights revealing a dozen or more scantly clad boys and girls necking and shirtless William is among them with one of the Groupies and another girl. William gets up, puts on a blue band shirt, turns the lights back off and follows Mike upstairs after saying he remembers what he was supposed to do tonight. - During the raid when the Yearbook Girl tries getting her yearbook floating on the swimming pool after William throws it in, she falls head first into the pool. She climbs out and runs into a group of kids running from the cops and falls back in the pool again. Then the Reminiscing Guy appears, pulls her out with of the pool as her savior with her yearbook and they make their getaway. - More scenes with William and the Stoned Guy who put marijuana in the mini dinosaur and inhales from the mouth and then gives it to William for a try. - As Preston is walking away from the trash cans after throwing away his letter to Amanda, he passes by a car where a girl's leg is sticking out of a window and the unmistakable sounds of lovemaking are heard from the car. - An extended scene with Kenny and his two Homeboys in the convenience store where they are talking while they are bringing their stuff to the cash register to purchase. - In the scene where the Hippy Girl is tasting a marijuana brownie with the Hippy Guy, she tells him that he's supposed to melt the weed in with the butter, not put it in the mix and then says: \"these brownies suck!\" and then throws it in the direction of Denise. - The final scene at the diner is expanded with a shot from the Yearbook Girl and the Reminiscing Guy looking at some romance between them, the shot moves to the next booths where they show the band of the bass player, drummer, guitarist and lead singer trying to make sense about the night before, to the Foreign Exchange Student and the Crying Drunk Girl having found each other and both talking in incoherent, nonsense language and understanding each other, to at least two other booths, including the Girl Whose Party it was, before stopping at the booth with Mike Dexter and his jock friends. - The final parts of 'where the characters are now' were changed. The original Kenny and Denise part originally read: Denise dumped Kenny later that day. Denise went to NYU, where she found a whole bunch of people just like her. Bored at it all, she dropped out and started shooting photo covers for Rolling Stone Magazine. She currently directed the latest music video for Wu-Tang Clan. - The original Kenny bit read: Kenny went to UCLA and found a bunch of people just like him. Unable to compete, he reinvented himself as an eco-conscious vegan nudist. He currently lives with a cult in Northern California. - Other character bios read: William's friends, Geoff Piccirilli and Murphy Pelan, did not go to college. They created a comic book called Citizen X about a man with no identity, no Social Security number, nothing, who uses his anonymity to infiltrate numerous conspiracies involving the government, aliens, and the abduction and subsequent probing of them and other innocent people by extraterrestrials. They are currently dating no one. - Another character quote reads: Amanda's cousin, Ron, is currently in prison. - The Girl Whose Party It Is was also featured and it reads: The Girl Whose Party It Was, Molly Stinson, dropped out of college her freshman year to work as an intern for her role model, Martha Stewart. Three months later, she was hospitalized for a nervous breakdown. She is currently working as a librarian. - The Crying Drunk Girl's character read: The Crying Drunk Girl, Mary Hampson, attended college for nearly two years, then dropped out to become a tour guide at the White House, a job she still holds. Her favorite times at work is leading groups of school children in an enthusiastic rendition of the Pledge of Allegiance.",

It was not officially submitted for UK cinema release until 1991 due to the film's graphic sexual nature and, although this print was fully uncut in terms of sexual footage, it featured an optical edit during the scene with the boy. Instead of removing the scene Ferman cropped off the bottom and far right of the screen, thus allowing the audience to realize the instability of Sada's character while removing the offending shot. The film first received a home video/DVD release in 2000 by Nouveaux and this print retained the optical edit, though the print itself was a shorter version and missed 6 minutes 15 secs of assorted dialogue and footage (the sexual footage remained uncut).

Many of the added or extended sequences involved Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie's characters. With battle of Gaugamela now starts earlier. Taking a cue from classic movie epics, the opening reels now set up the basic themes with greater economy: Alexander's Oedipal relationship with his parents, Olympias' ambitions for her son, the boy's need to surpass his father, and the entirely natural way in which myth/religion is shown as integral to the ancients' behavior. Oliver Stone reworked the third act, juxtaposing events in India and Greece. And Jolie's Olympias emerged more as a genuinely pathetic figure in the whole tragedy. Stone wanting to isolate her character's own ambition from the one person she loves. Ptolemy's final scene was edited. Stone also reworked Alexander's death scene secondary to audience feedback, adding 17 seconds to the scene.",
