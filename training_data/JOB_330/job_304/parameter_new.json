        "The differences as shown in the elongated TV version [indicated from a 1999 November showing on the Sci-Fi channel] are: - 1. Darkman (Arnold Vosloo) is introduced in the film immediately before the car chase; watching it from above. He then slides down a rope in front of a neon-lit sign. In a series of crosscutting, the car chase ensues as Darkman runs on rooftops. In the DVD/VHS version, Darkman is not introduced until after the car chase ends when the character Steve is shot; followed by a woman's scream. The shot of Darkman swinging down is never featured. The crosscutting of Darkman running only occurs as a gunman flees from the car wrecks. The TV version also features a shot of the policemen apprehending the immobilized gunman after Darkman's remark: \"Thanks for the donation.\" This single shot is absent from the DVD/VHS. - 2. After the scene where Peyton Westlake and Dr. David Brinkman (Jesse Collins) agree to be partners, Brinkman is seen waving off to a jetting Westlake replying solemnly, \"Partners...\" Directly afterward, a wide establishing tracking shot of Westlake's lab is featured. It then cuts to a medium shot of Westlake silently switching on a remote control. A radio is heard during these two shots reporting the weather. In the DVD/VHS version, none of this included. As Westlake jets out of Brinkman's lab, it cuts directly to a shot of Westlake's remote camera running across the floor with Westlake already at the controls. - 3. Westlake, once again in his lab, becomes enraged after reminiscing about what Dr. David Brinkman said to him before his murder. He screams savagely knocking objects off his desk, and then proceeds to run around his lab destroying additional objects. He is then interrupted by the TV's broadcast stating the name, \"Robert Durant...\" which features the character Jill Randall (Kim Delaney) and her live report. This then gives the motivation for Westlake to meet her. In the DVD/VHS version, this bit where he is interrupted by the TV is missing. - 4. When Westlake is confronted by Jill at the post office, the scene ends with a shot of her walking out the door and him in a close up holding up his scarred hands and then putting them to his face. This shot is missing in the DVD/VHS version. - 5. Before the scene where the character Eddie (David Ferry) is knocked out in the bathroom, a medium shot on a street corner shows Eddie stopping to look at his watch, and then him proceeding across the street with a silver briefcase. The shot eventually tilts up to reveal a large office building. In the DVD/VHS version, an exterior shot at the same street corner features the building, but no Eddie at all. It is a different shot because the traffic is not the same. - 6. When Darkman salutes Jill's photo seen on a TV in a store window, a shot shows him walk off with his cart further down to darker parts of the street as Randy Miller's musical score intensifies. The narration starts as the shot dissolves to a silhouette of Darkman looking out towards the city. In the DVD/VHS version, the narration starts at the shot of Darkman saluting, which then dissolves directly to the silhouette. - NOTE: Ordinarily, the intensely violent moments of the film are also removed to fit TV standards [depending on what that particular network allows].",

In English, Amy makes some sort of neutral comment. In English, one of the girls comments that Michelle and Amara are cousins. The English episode gets really mixed up in that the translators can't seem to decide if it's a \"Friendship Contest\" or a \"Love Contest\".  At the beginning they go to great effort to make it a \"Friendship\" contest, but then the part where Amara is embarrassed to call out Michelle's name doesn't make sense. At the end, when Melvin makes his love confession to Molly, the translators seem to give up on \"Friendship\" and it becomes a \"Love\" contest again. When the couples go to confess their love, one man charges towards the woman yelling something about love being a battle.  She conks him over the head with a giant mallet.  In English you see the \"before\" and \"after\" but not the actual bonk on the head.",

        "The Serbian DVD version is 160 minutes long and is a significantly different cut from any other DVD or video releases. There is no opening map and narration. The musical score is the original Vladimir Kraus-Rajteric score which kicks in very rarely. The scenes are rearranged so that Welles makes his speech to the troops near the beginning and the air attack hits Bihac simultaneously with the land battle. Almost every dialog scene is lengthened and cut slower than the English version, but there are some parts of the action scenes cut a lot tighter. For instance, this is missing the scene where Riva falls out of the truck during the Italian retreat. It is also missing the scene in the Orthodox church prior the Welles addressing the Chetniks. However, it does feature several new scenes, most notably a scene where Vasco raids a house in Prosor only to then shoot and wound his own commander, and then a second battle between the Partisans and the Italians. In this scene, Riva refuses to fire at his own men and Novak almost shoots him only for Martin to intervene. General Morelli is captured and then promptly commits suicide with a pistol. There is also a new scene where the partisans surprise attack a group of Chetniks guarding the Neretva bridge. There are several more violent shots missing from other prints - such as the Ustashans hanging an old woman and laughing when they march through Bihac. There are several more deaths during the end battle with the Chetniks such as a partisan being shot in the back when reaching for a grenade. Then at the end of the battle there is a scene where a partisan named 'Stipe' goes crazy and guns down a number of Chetnik prisoners, only to have his rank stripped from him. Curiously almost all the nationalities speak their own language; with Riva speaking Italian even with his Yugoslavian captors and Morelli speaking in German when addressing General Lohring. The only actors dubbed appear to be Yul Brynner and Orson Welles.",

        "The series pilot, \"Beauty and the Obese\", was first released as a 1/2-hour single episode and then as a longer 2-part episode with new footage. New stuff includes: - PART ONE -- 1. A slightly longer opening sequence on the model's runway where a skinny audience members mumbles \"I both love it and I hate it\" before the first model blimps up. - 2. In the first Tender Loins sequence, there is new footage starting with a conversation with the bartender and Persephone about her new boyfriend, whose brother she is going to meet. The boyfriend shows up and his brother is revealed to be his Siamese twin with an inexplicable British accent and snooty, patrician attitude. The manager then panics because Erotica hasn't shown up for work. This segues into a sequence where Erotica as Stripperella (This is Stripperella's (And Erotica's)first appearance in the two-parter, NOT the reveal of Erotica as she starts her act in the Tender Loins, as it is in the single episode version) rescues a baby from the lion's pit at a zoo. Giving the baby to its mother she is thanked but griped at because she destroyed the baby's heirloom blanket. She then talks to the zoo-keeper about moving the lion's pit to a place farther from the kids play area. She continues to give a lecture about increasing the lion's pit size before looking at her watch and realizing that she is late for work. Then we see a sign on the front of the Tender Loins advertising \"The Best Cervix in Town!\" The original footage picks up here. This whole sequence lasts for about 2 1/2 minutes. - 3. When Stripperella enters Flinderman's en route to FUGG headquarters, new footage has her stop to admire a shoe sale before her navel ring beeper beeps again, causing her to continue running to the secret door to the headquarters. - 4. After another model blimps up at the Stiffy Woods concert video, new footage shows a scene in the Tender Loins as Persephone is talking with her boyfriend. It starts when Persephone eats a Marcino cherry, revealing that she is able to do origami with her tongue when she works the stem and makes a miniature model of the Eiffel Tower. Her boyfriend is impressed, but the snotty Brit wannabe Siamese bother asks her if she learned that trick at \"whore school\". The date continues until the boyfriend chokes. Persephone performs the Heimlich maneuver, explaining that lots of strippers choke when they grab dollar bills with their teeth. The Brit wannabe remarks sarcastically about the anecdote, resulting in an argument. This lasts a little over a minute. - 5. The scene introducing Dr. Cesearean is extended when he makes the joke about seeing Enorma \"in the obituary column!\" The original scene ended when he went back into his office, whereas the new one continues with him laughing maniacally in his office as the the camera pulls out and reveals his waiting room filled with shocked onlookers. This ends with a \"To Be Continued\". - 6. The \"Next on Stripperella\" segment shows footage from Part Two, including a scene showing the Siamese twins fighting each other. - PART ONE runs for about 22 minutes without commercial.",

In late 2001, the second ending was shown in syndication for what was billed as the \"first and only time.\" This \"second ending\" is actually an extension of the original: Mary wakes up and goes to the Solomon's car and finds that Dick has given her the keys (you can see Dick tucking something in her hand in the original broadcast ending).

We learn now that he wasn't wearing a bathing suit - another scene shows Kathryn getting mad at her housekeeper, Mai-Lee. Mai-Lee accidently hurts Kathryn while doing her toe nails and Kathryn yells at her in Vietnamese - a third scene is from the end of the movie, when Kathryn and Annette meet each other in the bathroom of Manchester. Only a minor change of dialogue takes place here though - finally and most interestingly there is the alternate ending scene. Sebastian still gets hit by a car, but not because of saving Annette. He just stops fighting when he sees her standing across the street and gets hit when he crosses it. This scene is probably changed to the version as it appears in the movie because his death is more heroic that way.",

The knife wielding thug that attacks Dillon get his arm broken in the UK tape before he is thrown through the table. On the DVD the arm break is missing.

Police show up soon enough and trap Wadsworth, but not for long. He gets away from the chief and leaves, locking all the people in the mansion. But as he steals a police car, he notices a 'smell' (the dog dropping smell from the beginning of the film) and realizes the Doberman from earlier is now in the police car, and it lunges for him. The police car crashes, and Wadsworth is dead. This implies that the others got out okay now that the windows were not guarded by the Doberman any longer.",

As a result of the added narration, the enigmatic ending becomes easier to understand for North American viewers. The added narration actually creates a very large problem with the 'Polish with English subtitles' option on the Region 1 DVD, since the 'traslantion' subtitles are actually dub-titles (they simply transcribed the Enlgish dub as the Polish dialog). This results in innumerable inaccuracies in the script (almost all mention of the connections to the King Arthur myth are lost on any language of the Region 1 version), and the subtitles also show up during the sequences where the English version has narration, meaning that in the middle of a dialog-less scene, the subtitles will show up anyway.

This includes two excellent scenes cut from every version of the movie. At the beginning, as Arthur yells \"To the pit!\" the little bald guy with the whip (Gold Tooth) says \"To the pit with the blackguard!\" and charges Ash on his horse. Ash knocks him off the horse with his shotgun and is sucker-punched by Arthur, which Ash doesn't like, and knocks Arthur down. Arthur is shocked, but recovers to slap Ash's face lightly and order his men to \"Secure the prisoner.\" They do.  Another scene explains the mirror thing a little better, as Ash leaves the windmill to walk through an ominous forest, accidentally knocking into his horse. Saying \"You big piece of hamburger, c'mere,\" he ties the horse down until seeing a duplicate of himself in the windmill's doorway, which then slams shut. He runs back into the windmill and smashes headfirst into a mirror. These scenes are included in VERY rough scratched-up form in the \"director's cut\" DVD/VHS, along with another scene in which Ash is captured by Henry's men, including Rob Tapert. Henry stops them from killing Ash and laughs, calling Ash \"Mr. Fancypants.\" Ash convinces Henry to fight with him, saying \"You owe me.\" There is also an alternate opening on the DVD which is much more horror-like, omitting the S-Mart material and including more \"Evil Dead 2\"-style footage. This matches with the \"end of the world\" ending, as Ash appears to have a beard (only his eyes are shown to avoid giving this away too much).",

The musical score is the original Vladimir Kraus-Rajteric score which kicks in very rarely. The scenes are rearranged so that Welles makes his speech to the troops near the beginning and the air attack hits Bihac simultaneously with the land battle. Almost every dialog scene is lengthened and cut slower than the English version, but there are some parts of the action scenes cut a lot tighter. For instance, this is missing the scene where Riva falls out of the truck during the Italian retreat. It is also missing the scene in the Orthodox church prior the Welles addressing the Chetniks. However, it does feature several new scenes, most notably a scene where Vasco raids a house in Prosor only to then shoot and wound his own commander, and then a second battle between the Partisans and the Italians. In this scene, Riva refuses to fire at his own men and Novak almost shoots him only for Martin to intervene. General Morelli is captured and then promptly commits suicide with a pistol. There is also a new scene where the partisans surprise attack a group of Chetniks guarding the Neretva bridge. There are several more violent shots missing from other prints - such as the Ustashans hanging an old woman and laughing when they march through Bihac. There are several more deaths during the end battle with the Chetniks such as a partisan being shot in the back when reaching for a grenade. Then at the end of the battle there is a scene where a partisan named 'Stipe' goes crazy and guns down a number of Chetnik prisoners, only to have his rank stripped from him. Curiously almost all the nationalities speak their own language; with Riva speaking Italian even with his Yugoslavian captors and Morelli speaking in German when addressing General Lohring.

ABBY: It's all Marty's. - After Marty suggests to the P.I. the \"incinerator\" as a means of destroying the evidence of his proposed murder, the P.I.'s line: \"Sweet Jesus, you're disgusting!\" is deleted. - A couple lines from the landlady showing Abby the studio apartment (mainly assuring her Abby won't be bothered at that location) before she starts yelling at her ex-brother-in-law, are deleted. - As Marty opens his safe to retrieve the bounty money (and swap the photo) his line: \"This is an illicit affair\" has been removed, although he can still be seen mouthing it. - When the P.I. shoots Marty, a couple shots are removed of Marty and the P.I. staring at each other after the gunshot. - When Ray and Abby are discussing \"what happened\", in her studio apartment, and Ray feels cold enough to rise from his seat, the shot of him steadying the walrus piggy-bank is removed and his dialog is heard off-screen to cover this change. - When Abby goes to see Maurice about her concerns, the scene cuts as soon as she enters.

        "For the most part the episodes on the North American DVD box sets are the unedited versions as seen on the FOX network, however there are some instances where scenes have been cut or the syndicated version of an episode was placed on the DVD instead. This is most noticeable in Season 4, where 7 of the 22 episodes have some type of edit. The German region 2 Season 4 set uses non-syndicated versions of these episodes, although the Dutch and French sets have the syndicated versions. The DVD box sets from Season 3 onward do not feature the original \"Love and Marriage\" theme song in the opening sequence. This was done because Sony was unable to obtain the rights to the theme song. It is highly unlikely that the theme song will return in any yet to be released DVD box set. The replaced theme song was the cause of the syndicated versions of seven episodes in Season 4, as Sony falsely claimed did not have access to the original masters of these episodes, and had to use syndicated prints. This is proved wrong since they used the originals from Season 4 in \"Most Outrageous\" DVDs that contained some episodes. As the end credits had to be altered to credit the new theme song, certain scenes that originally ran during the end credits had to be replaced with a freeze frame. In most episodes affected, the original audio plays in the background while you see a freeze frame, however in a few cases a freeze frame is used, but the original audio is replaced with the theme song.",

The missing scenes are: - All of the scenes involving a character called the Crying Drunk Girl (Jennifer Elise Cox) who is so drunk that she has subtitles for when she speaks and she is the key to what is going on in movie. Her missing scenes of dialogue are: - After Preston and Denise talk with the Yearbook Girl, the Crying Drunk Girl walks up to them and says, \"Thush bezt weveram sisu gizem chext ear.\" (subtitle translation: \"This is the best party ever! I'm gonna miss you guys next year!) She group hugs them and walks away where Preston says, \"There's one at every party.\" - After Preston walks away from the Exchange Student at the backyard pool, the Crying Drunk Girl walks over to the Exchange Student and says to him, \"Idlik tach yre enis!\" (I'd like to touch your penis!) - When Kenny and Denise suddenly get locked in the upstairs bathroom and scream \"NOOOOO!!!\" the tracking shot from the bathroom door leads down the steps directly to the Crying Drunk Girl who somehow hears them and she says \"Yerd dum shelling yers chairs.\" (Did anyone hear that? Somebody's yelling for help upstairs!) But since no one can understand her, no help comes to Kenny or Denise. - When Amanda is talking to the Stoned Guy and the Watermelon Guy about who Preston is, the Crying Drunk Girl stumbles over to Amanda, leans on her shoulder, and says: \"Snow stun shy is shy sumber shess sing.\" (I know who Preston Meyers is. I can give you his phone number, his address, anything.) Unable to understand her, Amanda just shrugs her off and walks away. - During the police raid, one of the cops is talking to the Crying Drunk Girl on the front lawn of the house who asks her to stop crying and speak clearly and she says, \"I allred tdya, mnwans is mray hunds, ive at seveithg nolfok. (But I already told you! My name is Mary Hampson and I live and 1781 Norfolk!) Unable to understand her, the cop puts in her in a police van with Kenny's two Homboys and others who include the Hippy Girl, the Headbanger and others. - Also deleted was the scene involving the Stoned Girl (Amber Benson) who is glimpsed holding a banana as William walks through the kitchen to taste his first beer. It takes place in between the scenes where Kenny hits on Ashley and Jana where he sees her leaning against a dining room shelf and talks to her, but all she says is \"Okay\" everything he says. Then another girl walks in and thanks Kenny for finding her and says that Stephanie (the name of the Stoned Girl) just took three thingies of herbal ecstasy is so out of it. The girlfriend helps the Stoned Girl to her feet and they leave, leaving Kenny alone and downbeat. - Also deleted was the original opening which takes place in a bookstore the day before the graduation where Preston is talking to Denise about his desire for Amanda and his plans for going away to college. - When Kenny and his two homeboys first arrive at the party, Kenny plays around with a large sheepdog, named Mr. Tuxford, at the front door who belongs to the Girl Whose Party It Is, who jumps onto Kenny licking his face where he pushes the dog away who runs out the front door and the Girl runs after him. - There is more dialogue after when Kenny and Denise are released from the upstairs bathroom where the Girl Whose Party It Is continues yelling at Kenny and about the destruction they brought to her house as they are walking down the stairs where the house is now completely deserted and ransacked, and then the Girl's dog runs into the house and she drops to one knee and hugs the dog while Kenny takes this distraction to walk out and follow Denise. - A scene where the Watermelon Guy holds up a large watermelon and says \"This was in my freezer since September and I've poured six bottles of vodka into it and I've been saving it for this time!\" When all the guys around him grab at it, the watermelon falls on the kitchen floor splattering. - A scene in the \"make-out room\" where Mike Dexter enters looking for Amanda in the basement lit with dim red light and he turns on the basement lights revealing a dozen or more scantly clad boys and girls necking and shirtless William is among them with one of the Groupies and another girl. William gets up, puts on a blue band shirt, turns the lights back off and follows Mike upstairs after saying he remembers what he was supposed to do tonight. - During the raid when the Yearbook Girl tries getting her yearbook floating on the swimming pool after William throws it in, she falls head first into the pool. She climbs out and runs into a group of kids running from the cops and falls back in the pool again. Then the Reminiscing Guy appears, pulls her out with of the pool as her savior with her yearbook and they make their getaway. - More scenes with William and the Stoned Guy who put marijuana in the mini dinosaur and inhales from the mouth and then gives it to William for a try. - As Preston is walking away from the trash cans after throwing away his letter to Amanda, he passes by a car where a girl's leg is sticking out of a window and the unmistakable sounds of lovemaking are heard from the car. - An extended scene with Kenny and his two Homeboys in the convenience store where they are talking while they are bringing their stuff to the cash register to purchase. - In the scene where the Hippy Girl is tasting a marijuana brownie with the Hippy Guy, she tells him that he's supposed to melt the weed in with the butter, not put it in the mix and then says: \"these brownies suck!\" and then throws it in the direction of Denise. - The final scene at the diner is expanded with a shot from the Yearbook Girl and the Reminiscing Guy looking at some romance between them, the shot moves to the next booths where they show the band of the bass player, drummer, guitarist and lead singer trying to make sense about the night before, to the Foreign Exchange Student and the Crying Drunk Girl having found each other and both talking in incoherent, nonsense language and understanding each other, to at least two other booths, including the Girl Whose Party it was, before stopping at the booth with Mike Dexter and his jock friends. - The final parts of 'where the characters are now' were changed. The original Kenny and Denise part originally read: Denise dumped Kenny later that day. Denise went to NYU, where she found a whole bunch of people just like her. Bored at it all, she dropped out and started shooting photo covers for Rolling Stone Magazine. She currently directed the latest music video for Wu-Tang Clan. - The original Kenny bit read: Kenny went to UCLA and found a bunch of people just like him. Unable to compete, he reinvented himself as an eco-conscious vegan nudist. He currently lives with a cult in Northern California. - Other character bios read: William's friends, Geoff Piccirilli and Murphy Pelan, did not go to college. They created a comic book called Citizen X about a man with no identity, no Social Security number, nothing, who uses his anonymity to infiltrate numerous conspiracies involving the government, aliens, and the abduction and subsequent probing of them and other innocent people by extraterrestrials. They are currently dating no one. - Another character quote reads: Amanda's cousin, Ron, is currently in prison. - The Girl Whose Party It Is was also featured and it reads: The Girl Whose Party It Was, Molly Stinson, dropped out of college her freshman year to work as an intern for her role model, Martha Stewart. Three months later, she was hospitalized for a nervous breakdown. She is currently working as a librarian. - The Crying Drunk Girl's character read: The Crying Drunk Girl, Mary Hampson, attended college for nearly two years, then dropped out to become a tour guide at the White House, a job she still holds. Her favorite times at work is leading groups of school children in an enthusiastic rendition of the Pledge of Allegiance.",

Wat and Roland say there should be three phoenixes, since there's three of them. - Lord Adhemar's original introduction scene, where he slaps around one of his servants while having his armor fitted, and reference is made to the \"triple phoenix\" design of Sir Ulrich's crest. - Chaucer giving another substantial introduction for Sir Ulrich, similar to the first one, right before his match with Lord Adhemar. He berates Adhemar's herald before the speech; after the speech, Adhemar's herald appears impressed, which leads to his imitation of Chaucer's style later in the film. - When Adhemar leaves the dance, we find out the reason for his pained expression; in a deleted scene, he reveals to a monk that he is tone-deaf, and has never been able to hear music as anything more than noise. Adhemar then strides out into the midst of the poor, waiting outside the castle for handouts, and starts a riot by throwing food and money into the crowd. - Another deleted scene has Will, Roland, Wat, and Kate seeing Chaucer walking back to their quarters naked again. They follow him, but it turns that he was fetching food for his wife, Phillipa (who is also naked), and had not lost his clothes gambling like they thought. They leave, laughing, and run into Jocelyn and Christiana. Christiana and Roland leave together (with a suggestion of romance), William and Jocelyn leave together, but when Wat holds out his hand for Kate, she just hands him a pastry and walks off. Wat says \"Hey, Beautiful\" to the pastry and walks off happy anyway. - The original version of the scene with William in the stocks is considerably longer, and has an extensive speech by Chaucer (which is probably his best in the film). Rather than having the crowd calmed by the appearance of Prince Edward, the crowd is converted by Chaucer's speech, and has already begun chanting \"William, William!\" by the time the Prince reveals himself. A much stronger version of the scene, but cut down in favor of having the Prince's role expanded.",

Ransohoff also tried to have the American version distributed under the title \"The Fearless Vampire Killers: or, Pardon Me But Your Teeth are in my Neck\". Upon seeing this American version, Polanski tried to have his name removed from the credits. The prints that are currently being used have been restored to their original British length of 107 minutes and carry the title of simply \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\".",

Cap then holds the dying female spy in his arms and is reminded of his girlfriend, Bernie, back in the United States. - There is an additional scene which explores the character of the Red Skull more, and it attempts to make him look much more like a tragic figure, haunted by his painful past. In the 1990's, as Steve Rogers is reviewing the deaths of Martin Luther King and John Kennedy and realizing that the Red Skull is to blame, the Red Skull is shown weeping over the piano seen at the end of the film, re-living the visitation of the Italian army storming into his house, shooting his family, and kidnapping him for their experiments.

The later release from Blackhorse featured the same cut print.

        "All prints of the original version of \"The Cage\" were destroyed by Paramount sometime in the sixties...or so it was thought. For over two decades, the only surviving copy had been a 16mm black and white proof print personally owned by Gene Roddenberry. Mr. Roddenberry took this proof print with him on the college lecture circuit throughout the 70's and early 80's. As a result of many showings in dilapidated 16mm projectors, it has become badly scratched and damaged. One of the versions available on video is a re-created hybrid of the original, using the B&W proof print as a reference, reconstructed from footage used in the episode \"The Menagerie\" (transferred from the original color camera negatives) and the deleted footage (as originated from the B&W proof print)...this version was originally released on video in the 1980s (and most recently on DVD) with a special introduction by Gene Roddenberry. Then, a few years later, in 1988, a full-color original print of the episode was discovered in the Paramount archives and then released as a filler episode during the original syndication run of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" due to a Hollywood strike (it was later shown during the Sci-Fi Channel's first run of the original \"Star Trek\" series). The original soundtrack to the discovered print was missing, but the re-mixed soundtrack used for the previous hybrid B&W/color version (in which the \"Menagerie\" soundtrack was used wherever possible to avoid using the severely scratched and degraded optical soundtrack from the proof print) was re-synched to this restored full-color version to make it look and sound whole. In any event, the most significant difference in the existing versions of the pilot is the voice of the Keeper. In the numberous restored versions, it switches between that of actor Vic Perrin in the footage taken from \"The Menagerie\" and that of Malachi Throne in the restored footage. This is because, coincidentally, Malachi Throne was cast as Commodore Mendez in \"The Menagerie\". The producers, quite rightly, thought that it would be confusing for Commodore Mendez and The Keeper to have the same voice, so The Keeper's lines were re-dubbed. (All Thelosian characters were played by women with dubbed male voices.) Among the other addtional scenes/differences in the original version-- -Pike discovers a monster lurking in the Talosians' chambers during the Captain's imprisonment; an extended version of Pike's first illusion, set on the planet Rigel VII (referred to earlier in the film by the ship's doctor) -Spock and crew suspect that their weapons are an illusion by the Talosians -extended dialogue by the Keeper about \"Number One\" -an extended illusion scene set in the countryside -an extended version of the Orion Slave Girl sequence -the Enterprise loses power as they are about to escape from Talos, and the computer bank goes out of control (both a result of the Talosians' telepathic powers) -and an extended closing scene aboard the bridge.",

Interestingly, Dimension cut all references to the family have these kind of domestic issues with the daughter. - Following the first scene at the swimming pool, there is a brief scene where Regina is visited by her boyfriend Carlos ('Fele Martinez' (qv)) in the girls' locker room. They talk briefly about him coming over and she chastises him for sneaking into the locker room. A girl walks by in the background in a towel and no nudity is in the scene. When Mark ('Iain Glen' (qv)) is driving Paul ('Stephan Enquist' (qv)) to school, Paul asks, \"Are you and Mom going to split up?\" Mark responds by saying that \"only families that don't get along split up.\" - After Mark arrives home from the hospital, Regina has an argument with her mom on the front porch. The US version edits a section of dialogue where the mom says, \"If you don't like it here than you can just get your things together and go.\" - Following this fight, Regina visits Carlos in his apartment. She tells him about the argument while he develops photographs. - Following her father's row with the electrician, there is an extra scene where Regina returns to her room where Carlos is painting. He surprises her by taking a photograph (during the flash the ghost children are seen; it figures in later). She says to him, \"I'm staying.\" When Carlos asks why, Regina tells him not to ask her and only says, \"I can't leave now.\" - Regina and Carlos have additional dialogue before the scene where she tells him about her father condition at the swimming pool. She reiterates that he shouldn't ask her what is going on. - During Mark's second attack when he begins cutting the potatoes franticly with the knife, there are a series of flashes back to his past. After he cuts his hand, there are several close ups of the bloody hand and blood dripping onto the floor. - Two extra scenes appear back to back. One has Regina and Carlos in front of a computer looking up information and discovering \"Ouroboros\" and a website outlining some of the ritual. The other has the architect discovering the original letter with the design plans of the house while he is digging through papers. The US version cuts straight to Carlos and Regina in the library.",

West Coast: This time, Baldwin doesn't pick up anything until he gets the line out first. - 2. East Coast: In a flashback, Julia Louis-Dreyfus references _Slumdog Millionaire (2008)_ (qv) by calling to Jonathan with, \"Yeah, Chai Boy, get in here. You'll never be a millionaire.\" West Coast: Instead, Louis-Dreyfus references _Aladdin (1992)_ (qv) by saying, \"Hurry up, Aladdin, before Jasmine is forced to marry Jafar!\" - 3. East Coast: Jane Krakowski sings the 30 Rock opening, which has lyrics questioning the wisdom of throwing a live show. West Coast: Cheyenne Jackson sings the 30 Rock opening, incorporating region-specific lines like \"Let's talk about sushi\" and \"Portland, Vegas, Glendale, this is 30 Rock!\" - 4. East Coast: There's a bad boom mic shadow at the end of the Rachel Dratch elevator scene. West Coast: Fixed! - 5. East Coast: Liz tells Tracy, \"Audiences love it when something goes wrong,\" and the Who Dat Ninja poster swings lazily in the background a beat too late. West Coast: The poster cue gets nailed. - 6. East Coast: As Liz leaves his dressing room, Tracy tells his entourage, \"Gentlemen, tonight I'm gonna laugh harder than I did at Dotcom's play.\" West Coast: Tracy Morgan totally butchers the line, realizes it, and starts grinning. - 7. East Coast: Jenna tells Pete about her song, \"It's Your Birthday, Slut.\" West Coast: Jane Krakowski forgets the \"slut\" part of her line briefly, but recovers. - 8. East Coast: According to online surveys, Jack \"has a drinking problem.\" West Coast: According to online surveys, Jack \"is a problem drinker.\" The difference is small but profound. - 9. East Coast: During TGS's Fox News sketch, the chyron for President Obama reads, \"Exclusive Interview with Kenyan Liar.\" West Coast: This time, it reads \"Impartial Interview with Barack Obammunist.\" - 10. East Coast: In his commercial, Dr. Spaceman's first song includes the line, \"Light some candles, draw a bath, and start off with full-on intercourse.\" West Coast: It's been revised to \"Light some candles, draw a bath, and tie me to my radiator and put food just out of reach.\" - 11. East Coast: Spaceman's second song goes, \"Baby, let's let the dog watch us. Do you think he understands the love that we have? Oops, I'm finished, call yourself a cab.\" West Coast: Now it's \"Girl, I've been knowing you a long time, and I think tonight's the night / This time, you can be the man.\" - 12. East Coast: Matt Damon's first appearance in the show gets wild cheers at the beginning and end of his scene. West Coast: Complete silence from the audience. - 13. East Coast: A paint-sniffing Jack tells Liz, \"Men need alcohol. It's the first thing every civilization makes, along with weapons and shelters to enjoy prostitutes.\" West Coast: This time, Jack says, \"Men need alcohol. It gives us the ability to hit on women, and later, when we're married, to tune them out.\" - 14. East Coast: Flashback Jack Donaghy makes out with one of his three dancing ladies. West Coast: Flashback Jack is much more chaste, though still barechested. - 15. East Coast: Jon Hamm appears as his hook-handed character Drew Baird, narrating a commercial like so: \"Thanks to an idea that started as a pitch for a horror movie and then grew into a charitable organization, hands from executed criminals are now making life better for people all over the world.\" West Coast: It's been changed to: \"Thanks to groundbreaking research at the Yale University for hand frankensteining, hand transplants are a reality.\" - 16. East Coast: Drew shows off his transplanted hand, which is a little bit scary-looking and tries to choke him. West Coast: Now, Drew's new hand is from a lady: \"Donors are rare. As you can see, I've had to accept a female hand.\" The hand strokes his face and then goes towards his crotch. \"Oh God,\" he moans. \"Please take off your rings!\" - 17. East Coast: In the final scene, Liz is happy with how her birthday went. After all, she even \"got to eat the cake off the floor.\" West Coast: This time, she \"ate the Fonz's face.\" Still off the floor, presumably.",

Among the highlights are: - A flashback with Frank Lucas and Bumpy Johnson on a boardwalk - A short scene showing Richie Roberts acquiring office space for his new narcotics task force (this added scene follows immediately after Toback assigns Roberts to head up the federal investigation using honest cops of Roberts' choice) - A nighttime scene where Roberts and his team tail a drug pusher with a stash of Blue Magic to an auto body shop; the next morning, Spearman strikes a deal with the shop owner \"Scott\" over the phone, which leads up to Roberts under disguise dropping off $20,000 to get a supply of Blue Magic - In the Bronx, right after Spearman drops off Roberts and informs him that he'll circle the block, an extended scene takes place where Roberts sees both Scott take off in his Jeep and Spearman getting blocked by a broken-down truck, unable to reach Roberts. In desperation, Roberts stops a yellow cab and shows his badge, argues with the uncooperative cabbie to use it, and eventually decks the cabbie in the face to take control of the cab and quickly pursues the escaping drug pusher, ending with Roberts following the unsuspecting Scott on foot. - After the Christmas visit with Charlie Williams, there's an extended scene with Frank and Eva back at their home, where Frank reminisces how Bumpy gradually stayed more and more at home towards the end of his life because of constant police surveillance. He then asks Eva if she wants to go out, nevertheless. - An extended ending in 1991 where Lucas upon release from jail is picked up by Roberts, and the two make their way towards the intersection of 116 St. and Frederick Douglass Blvd, conversing while drinking lattes.",

        "A \"Special Edition\" version was released in 1980 (3 years after the film's original theatrical release). The original production of \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" was plagued with schedule and budget problems. Spielberg originally wanted to release the film in the summer of 1978, however, Columbia Pictures (who were undergoing financial troubles at the time) insisted that Spielberg have it ready by November 1977. Therefore many scenes Spielberg had scripted couldn't be filmed as he originally intended due to time constraints. After the movie's huge success, Spielberg asked Columbia to allow him to re-cut the picture and to shoot additional sequences; the studio agreed at the condition that he included new scenes showing the inside of the alien mothership (to entice audiences into the theater again). Spielberg was given a budget of $1.5 million and seven weeks to shoot the new sequences (some of which were shot while he was also directing 1941 (1979)). He had to use a different director of photography (Allen Daviau) because Vilmos Zsigmond was unavailable, and he was able to convince most of the original cast to re-appear, with the exception of director Francois Truffaut (who played French scientist Lacombe) who was on location shooting a film at the time. For years, Steven Spielberg considered the Special Edition the only \"real\" version of the movie and dismissed the original as an inferior \"work-in-progress\". According to Columbia, all prints of the original version have been destroyed (apart from a few copies kept in the studio's vault for historical value only). Only the Special Edition had been the version available on video until Criterion became the first company to release different versions of the film in any video format. The following are the differences between the Original Version (O.V.) and the Special Edition (S.E.): - In the O.V. after Barry runs outside his house and into the night, there's a cut to a music box playing \"When you wish upon the star\" and then to Roy Neary's house, where he receives a phone call from his boss at the power station. In the S.E. after Barry leaves the house we see a panoramic shot of the city at night instead; the next scene shows Roy playing with a toy train in order to explain to his son what a fraction is. There's an argument between Roy, his wife and his kids (they want to go play Goofy Golf, he wants to go see \"Pinocchio\" but is outvoted). Then Roy's boss calls. - After Jillian Guiler looks for her son Barry in the woods, the O.V. version shows Roy Neary at the power station where workers are discussing the power failures and his supervisor tells him to go check an area of the city. The Special Edition deletes this scene. - The S.E. adds a new scene, after Roy see's the UFO flyby on the road: a UFO stops in front of a McDonald's sign and flashes its light on it, as if to read it. - An old man sees the UFOs fly by on the road and says \"They can fly rings around the moon, but we're years ahead of them on the highway\". This scene is missing from the S.E. - The S.E. adds a scene in which U.S. soldiers and scientists discover the ship, the \"Cotopaxi\" in the Gobi desert. This scene is inserted right after the one where Roy and his wife watch the sky in the spot where he first saw the UFOs. - A scene where Roy and his wife argue right after he's fired from his job. Roy lies on his bed and looks at a pillow (whose shape resembles the Devil's Tower mountain) The pillow segment was removed in the S.E. - The S.E. version changes the chronology of sequences from the mid-section of the O.V. In the O.V. the scene where Roy is fired is followed by the scene where he goes back to the road with his camera, which is followed by The India sequence and then Lacombe's auditorium speech. In the S.E. these scenes are flip-flopped. The scene where Roy is fired is followed by the India sequence, which is followed by Lacombe's auditorium speech, followed by the scene where Roy goes back to the road with his camera. - In the S.E. Lacombe's auditorium speech is slightly longer containing the applause of the dignitaries. - The S.E. deletes a scene at an Air Force base after Lacombe and the military argue about the best way to scare the population away from the alien's landing area. In the original Jillian is interviewed by reporters about her son's kidnapping, and Roy and Ronnie arrive at the base to attend a press conference about UFOs. Roy draws the shape of the Devil's Tower on a newspaper over the photo of Jillian and the headline \"Cosmic Kidnapping\". However, the headline is misspelled as 'kidnaping'. - In the O.V. during the dinner/mashed potato sequence. The scene begins with the kids arguing at the table. As soon as Roy walks into the room they immediately stop shouting. In the S.E. this portion is deleted and the scene begins with Ronnie handing Toby the mashed potatoes. - The S.E. adds a sequence where Roy breaks down and he locks himself in the bathroom and goes under the running shower. Ronnie breaks the door open and yells at him, holding him responsible for their family falling apart. - The scene where Roy tosses bricks and bushes into his house so he can make the Devil's tower replica was almost entirely removed in the S.E. version. The S.E. only includes the portion of the scene where Ronnie actually leaves with the kids. - When Ronnie leaves Roy and almost runs him over with her car, the O.V. shows him getting back inside the house from a window. This scene is missing from the S.E. The sequence when Roy arrives in Wyoming and meets Jillian at the train station while the population is being evacuated by the army is shorter in the S.E.: in the original we saw Roy trying to convince a soldier (played by Carl Weathers) to let him go look for his \"sister\": the guard says he has orders to shoot anyone that trespasses. - The S.E. adds a new ending that shows what happens after Roy enters the mothership, with light/sound special effects by Douglas Trumbull. - In the S.E. the end title music is different. Instead of the closing \"overture\" music originally commissioned for the credits, we hear an arrangement of \"When You Wish Upon A Star\".",

This cut was re-edited by Coppola and Walter Murch and features a new Technicolor dye prints with additional footage originally left out of thetheatrical release. The new version is 197 minutes long (53 minutes longer than the original version). The restored footage also includes the French plantation scenes with Aurore Clement and Christian Marquand, as well as scenes from the crew meeting the Playmates later on. - There are additional scenes when the crew is with Kilgore. During the napalm strike, he helps a wounded Vietnamese child. The napalm strike has ruined the favorable surfing conditions, so Lance and the others leave, much to Kilgore's dismay. Before they leave, Willard steals Kilgore's surfboard. Finally, just before Willard and Chef leave the boat to search for mangoes, a helicopter files by with Kilgore on loudspeaker, asking for his surfboard back. - In the Playmate scenes, Willard trades two drums of oil in exchange for spending two hours with the Bunnies. We see Chef with Miss May in a helicopter, and Lance with the Playmate of the Year in a ransacked house. Miss May was once a bird trainer at Busch Gardens and tries to talk about birds with Chef while he is busy trying to get her to re-enact her photo that he showed the crew. They end up kissing and Miss May gets excited because Chef kisses like a bird. The Playmate of the Year is talking to Lance about her troubles and insecurities about being a Playmate. Clean is seen trying to barge in on both men, and when he barges in on Lance, the Playmates open a chest (in which to hide) and discovers a dead Vietnamese. Lance comforts her. Chef finds out afterwards that Clean is a virgin and starts calling him names on the boat. Willard told Chief that the whole crew can spend time with the Bunnies, but Chief refuses. - At the plantation, Chef figures that they are French first and tells them in French that they are Americans and are friends. They bury Clean with his tape player there, and eat dinner with the French. The crew eats with the staff, and Willard eats with the family. Chef wants to speak to the chef but is informed he only speaks Vietnamese. Willard is lectured about France's colonial history in Indochine as well as their military blunders. There also is a scene with Willard and Roxanne, one of the French women, smoking opium. - At the Kurtz compound, Willard is imprisoned in an oven-like box. Kurtz appears, accompanied by a group of children. He reads to Willard from Time magazine articles about the Vietnam War.",

        "The New Line Platinum Series DVD contains several deleted scenes, including: An extended opening scene establishing Prague. A flashback sequence showing Blade's first encounter with Whistler, part of which can be seen in the film's title credits. An extended version of the ninja fight in the warehouse, with Blade using some fencing tactics to keep Asad at bay. A scene of Whistler shying away from the growing daylight outside. An alternate take of Blade's first meeting with Damaskinos, with Damaskinos wearing, according to 'Guillermo del Toro' (qv), a \"Michael Bolton wig\". A scene in which Damaskinos explains the effects vampirism has had on him. A much longer version of the House of Pain sequence, including a scene with Nyssa finding a room upstairs with a man unpacking human entrails from a box, a scene that was meant for 'Michael Jackson (I)' (qv). A line by Whistler about \"the power of the pussy\" A Bloodpack \"meeting\" of sorts, with Chupa attempting to urge the others to kill Blade and go after the Reapers on their own. A scene in a bathroom after the House of Pain sequence of Lighthammer discovering how far his infection with the Reaper strain has gone. An extended scene of Damaskinos' dinner and blood bath, in which he tells of the fate of his human heart. An extended scene of the lawyer's torture of Blade A \"dirty\" version of the final scene, in which semen is streaked on the windows that was digitally removed in the final cut of the film because test audiences complained.",
