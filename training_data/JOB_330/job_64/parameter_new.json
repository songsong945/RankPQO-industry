        "A few months before the release of the sequel, Capcom issued a new version of the game known as the \"Director's Cut\", which contained an \"Arrange\" mode in addition to the original game. The Arranged Mode allowed the player to experience the game with different camera angles in some areas, new costumes for the main characters (including Rebecca), different item and enemy placement and a new monster in the game. A later version of Director's Cut, known as the \"Dual Shock version\", contained vibration and analog support for Sony's Dual Shock controller, as well as a new soundtrack composed by Mamoru Samuragoch. The Japanese release included a bonus disc known as the \"Complete Disc\" (in the place of the Biohazard 2 demo), which contained downloadable save data and gameplay footage from the scrapped version of Biohazard 2."

        "When the series was cancelled from CBS in 1984, the show found a new home on Public Television. From September, 1986 to November, 1992, 65 episodes from the 70's and 80's of the show played on PBS in severely altered re-runs. Altered in the sense that everything except the running storyline of the episode was cut, resulting in the running time dropping from one hour to 12 to 17 minutes.  To fill the running time, elements from the 1981-1982 \"Wake up\" version (none of which were made into PBS versions), and other late episodes, such as Bill Cosby's \"Picture Pages\" segments, and scenes with Kevin Clash's troupe of puppets, making each episode around 28 minutes on PBS.  These versions also featured a new theme song (the much more upbeat \"Here Comes Captain Kangaroo!\" theme replaced the CBS \"Good Morning, Captain\" opening) and opening credit segment,  showing clips from the series rather than the previous, partly animated opening. One of the many hour-long videos released in 1984-1986 (when the show was between homes) was \"Captain Kangaroo and His Friends\".  This tape featured PBS-like versions of the episodes featuring Joan Rivers, Phil Donahue, and Dolly Parton, as well as scenes with Town Clown and the Bananna Man.\tNew intro's with the Captain were also inserted.\tReportedly, this has been aired as a special on PBS during pledge drives while the show was on the air."

        "A 289min long workprint version exists. It has never been officially released but circulates as a video bootleg. The bootleg contains the following extra material not included in either the original theatrical release or the \"redux\" version. - A longer opening montage, the entire 10 minute song \"The End\" by The Doors is heard.It intercuts longer helicopters/jungle images with Willard in the hotel room in a drunken rage, as well as a scene where he is with a prostitute. There are various shots outside depicting the streets of Saigon. - When the two soldiers pick up Willard in the hotel room there is a brief conversation while they help him shower and shave. They notify him that his wait for his new mission is now over. - The scene where Willard is given his assignment is longer and contains much more dialogue. The general informs Willard that the mission is purely voluntary and he can decline it. The general also offers Willard a promotion to major upon completion of the mission. For some reason Colonel Kurtz is referred to in this scene as \"Colonel Leevy\". There are some external shots of the military base. - A brief scene where Willard is introduced to the crew of the Navy P.B.R. - Carmine Coppola's score is not present in this version. Many more songs by The Doors are played throughout the film instead. - None of the narration or dossier voiceovers are in this version. - There is no audio dubbing in this version. All the audio is from the sound recorded during the actual filming. Much of Robert Duvall's dialogue is unitelligable due to the sound of the helicopters in his scenes. - A much longer first cavalry \"Ride of Valkyrie\" attack scene (30+ mins)showing much unused footage and alternate takes. - A much longer playboy bunnies performance. - Various extended scenes on the boat, and alternate takes and shots. - A scene where a miniature toy boat passes the Navy PBR. Lance tries to grab it out of the water. The Chief yells at him to leave it alone claiming it's a booby trap. To prove it the Chief fires some shots at it to which it explodes. - When the P.B.R. reaches Do-lung bridge, the soldier that greets them gives a more detailed explanation of the chaos around the bridge. - When Lance is reading his letters on the boat, he suddenly stops to machine gun a water buffalo on the shore. The Chief yells at him to stop. - The sequence where Clean is killed is omitted. - A slightly longer French plantation sequence. After the French woman strips she crawls into the bed with Willard and they begin kissing. - The sequence where the Chief is killed is omitted. - More dialogue between Willard and the photojournalist when they first reach the Kurtz compound. The Journalist reveals that it was HE who was able to get the montangnards to break off their attack on the boat in the previous scene. Willard repeatedly asks the Journalists name but he refuses to answer. - The character of Colby, (the soldier who was sent before Willard to kill Kurtz, played by Scott Glenn) has a much more substantial role in this version. As Willard inspects the compound, Colby tells Willard that the night before, NVA soldiers had attacked (which explains all the bodies laying about the compound). Willard then enters Kurtz's house, much to the dismay of the journalist. Willard sees Kurtz empty bed and his medals, also his journal with the inscription \"Drop the bomb, exterminate them all\" (many of these scenes were in the final version but re-inserted in different places). - The scene where Willard talks to Chef about the air strike on the boat is omitted. - In this version. The first time Kurtz appears is the scene where a mud caked Willard is tied up (seated) to a pole in the rain. Kurtz appears with camouflage face paint, Willard asks....\"Why he is being mistreated?\" and tries to bluff his way past Kurtz by telling him that he had just completed a secret mission in Cambodia, and only stopped for supplies. Kurtz says nothing to him, but plants Chef's head in his lap. (Only a portion of this scene was in the original version). - The scene where Willard meets Kurtz in his bed chamber contains more dialogue....as Kurtz makes it clear that he knows why Willard is there. - A scene where Kurtz talks to Willard in the bamboo cage while two children sit on top of the cage and dangle insects in Willard's face. He tells him that Willard is \"like his colleagues in Washington, master liars who want to win the war but don't want to appear as immoral or unethical\". - A lengthy scene where the montangnards in a ritualistic display pick up the bamboo cage (with Willard inside) and poke him with sticks (Lance and Colby participate in this). The natives dance around the bamboo cage, chanting and singing while a squealing pig is tied up and killed. - A 10 minute version of the scene where Kurtz reads the poem \"The Hollow Men\", intercutting between his reading and the journalist talking with Willard. - A scene where the journalist meets Willard to tell him that he thinks Kurtz is about to kill him because he took his picture again. During which Colby comes behind the journalist and shoots him three times, killing him. Willard throws a knife at Colby's stomach to which he falls, but before he dies he asks Willard to talk to his family for him and asks him to kill Kurtz. - Kurtz speech about the horror and the children vaccination are omitted. - During the assassination scene at the end, before Willard enters Kurtz' home, one of the guards confronts him. Willard picks up a spear to defend himself as the guard picks up a child to shield himself. Willard runs the spear right through the child and into the guard. The final scene with Willard and the montangnards after Kurtz assasination are omitted."

To release the film at all, German distributor Kinowelt had to cut the film. This cut version still only had the SPIO/JK approval and no FSK rating. Among the cut scenes were the following: - Kitano killing Fujiyoshi with his knife - Kitano killing Nobu by activating the collar - All notes telling the viewer who was killed and how many survivors were left were deleted - Mitsuko killing Megumi with a sickle - Much of Kitanos comments, such as \"It's tough when friends die on you, but hang in there!\" - Kiriyama killing the two girls with the MP was shortened - View of Kitano's picture was shortened - Nanahara saying \"She took the knife that Nobu use to stab Kitano from the desk.\" In 2004 the film was re-released by Marketing Film, this time it was uncut."

The other scene involved Heffer saying good bye to the milking machine which took place before him and Rocko left the ranch.

As a result of the added narration, the enigmatic ending becomes easier to understand for North American viewers. The added narration actually creates a very large problem with the 'Polish with English subtitles' option on the Region 1 DVD, since the 'traslantion' subtitles are actually dub-titles (they simply transcribed the Enlgish dub as the Polish dialog). This results in innumerable inaccuracies in the script (almost all mention of the connections to the King Arthur myth are lost on any language of the Region 1 version), and the subtitles also show up during the sequences where the English version has narration, meaning that in the middle of a dialog-less scene, the subtitles will show up anyway. Miramax has not recalled or corrected the DVD, but an uncut anamorphic version with proper subtitles is available from UK company Blue Light."

        "The differences as shown in the elongated TV version [indicated from a 1999 November showing on the Sci-Fi channel] are: - 1. Darkman (Arnold Vosloo) is introduced in the film immediately before the car chase; watching it from above. He then slides down a rope in front of a neon-lit sign. In a series of crosscutting, the car chase ensues as Darkman runs on rooftops. In the DVD/VHS version, Darkman is not introduced until after the car chase ends when the character Steve is shot; followed by a woman's scream. The shot of Darkman swinging down is never featured. The crosscutting of Darkman running only occurs as a gunman flees from the car wrecks. The TV version also features a shot of the policemen apprehending the immobilized gunman after Darkman's remark: \"Thanks for the donation.\" This single shot is absent from the DVD/VHS. - 2. After the scene where Peyton Westlake and Dr. David Brinkman (Jesse Collins) agree to be partners, Brinkman is seen waving off to a jetting Westlake replying solemnly, \"Partners...\" Directly afterward, a wide establishing tracking shot of Westlake's lab is featured. It then cuts to a medium shot of Westlake silently switching on a remote control. A radio is heard during these two shots reporting the weather. In the DVD/VHS version, none of this included. As Westlake jets out of Brinkman's lab, it cuts directly to a shot of Westlake's remote camera running across the floor with Westlake already at the controls. - 3. Westlake, once again in his lab, becomes enraged after reminiscing about what Dr. David Brinkman said to him before his murder. He screams savagely knocking objects off his desk, and then proceeds to run around his lab destroying additional objects. He is then interrupted by the TV's broadcast stating the name, \"Robert Durant...\" which features the character Jill Randall (Kim Delaney) and her live report. This then gives the motivation for Westlake to meet her. In the DVD/VHS version, this bit where he is interrupted by the TV is missing. - 4. When Westlake is confronted by Jill at the post office, the scene ends with a shot of her walking out the door and him in a close up holding up his scarred hands and then putting them to his face. This shot is missing in the DVD/VHS version. - 5. Before the scene where the character Eddie (David Ferry) is knocked out in the bathroom, a medium shot on a street corner shows Eddie stopping to look at his watch, and then him proceeding across the street with a silver briefcase. The shot eventually tilts up to reveal a large office building. In the DVD/VHS version, an exterior shot at the same street corner features the building, but no Eddie at all. It is a different shot because the traffic is not the same. - 6. When Darkman salutes Jill's photo seen on a TV in a store window, a shot shows him walk off with his cart further down to darker parts of the street as Randy Miller's musical score intensifies. The narration starts as the shot dissolves to a silhouette of Darkman looking out towards the city. In the DVD/VHS version, the narration starts at the shot of Darkman saluting, which then dissolves directly to the silhouette. - NOTE: Ordinarily, the intensely violent moments of the film are also removed to fit TV standards [depending on what that particular network allows]."

In addition, Chris was originally shown lighting a cigarette during the cast's introduction (this was replaced by superimposed colored footage of early shots of Chris from the intro). The second FMV movie altered was with the encounter with the first Zombie, in which showed Kenneth's half-eaten head is drop into the floor before the zombie himself faces the player. The third and final FMV that was change was Chris' \"bad\" ending, which was reshot so that Chris is no longer shown smoking (SCEA reportedly forbids any \"glorification\" of tobacco use in their games, despite the fact that SCEI has no problem with them).

The film was re-released on CIC video in the early 1990s in an 'uncut' version with all language left in, rated '18'. Strangely, both versions on CIC video altered Reggie's singing in the prison cell. Whereas in the original version of the film he was singing \"Roxanne\" by the Police, on the video he is singing a different song, probably because of copyright/licensing reasons - it has even been removed from the end credits. In order to remove the song it was dubbed in by an Eddie Murphy soundalike, but the other dialogue in the scene (when you can hear Reggie's singing in the background) had to be dubbed over as well. This has ended up with Jack's dialogue being spoken by someone other than Nick Nolte. The replacement actor's voice is very high-pitched, which is unintentionally rather amusing."

This redub mangles the captioning track--garbage appears all throughout it.  However, it is still legible enough to pick up the original dialogue (Ryoko's line about \"seeing you in your birthday suit\", for instance), leaving anyone relying on captions likely confused."

Esteban's run in the city to the tavern is shorter, but an additional overhead shot is shown. The scene in which Pedro and Sancho are telling the story about the city of gold is shortened (they don't talk about how the patrons of the bar should invest in their adventure.) There is an additional scene of Esteban looking shocked when the official says \"find him and you'll receive a whole piece of gold.\" There is a scene difference in when Mendoza is waiting for Esteban at the dock, he waits longer, but Esteban's run to meet him is shorter. The ending of Episode 1 is omitted in that Esteban discovers Zia only. The scene in which Mendoza smiles at the discovery that Esteban makes of Zia, and the both looking to see the clouds turn into the winged serpent forshadowing things to come is not there. - Episode 2: The daydreaming scene in which the golden butterflies turns into the city of gold is omitted, as well as the daydreaming scene in which Esteban is seasick and floating above the mayan ruins. - Episode 3: The daydreaming scene of the seamonster eating the ship is omitted. - Episode 4: Has the longest runtime of all the episodes of the series contains many additions, cuts, and an alternate ending. Additions include Extended footage of Mendoza rescuing the children with Esteban grabbing onto him through the bars so he doesn't get sucked out, followed by Dialogue of Gomez on the deck of the ship saying something about Gaspard. Gomez then slides down the deck of the ship and gets into the boat. There is a scene added in which Pedro and Sancho wake up in each others arms on the deck of the Esperanza when Esteban calls to Mendoza about the St. Elmos fire. There is also an extended scene after the shark attack where Pedro and Sancho say something off camera, and goes into an on camera dialogue with Esteban and Zia's dialogue about Esteban's father. - Omitted scene: There is a small scene of the raft sitting still in the sunlight. - Alternate Ending: Once the Island is discovered our heroes merely paddle their way toward the island, seeing shots of the lizards, and shots of the island. The Episode ends right here, and the entire footage in the English/French versions of Mendoza swimming from the sharks is gone. - Some of the scenes from Episode 4 alternate ending and the rescue can be seen in the English/French version Previous and To Follow segments - Episode 5: This starts where the English/French Episode 4 ends at the raft on the island. There is a scene omission of Zia lifting her dress to sit down. This Episode ends right where Tao points the crossbow at Esteban. - Episode 6: Starts in the tree house right where Episode 5 left off, and has a small scene of Mendoza Pedro and Sancho arriving on the raft. From this point forward all Episodes are in Synch with the English/French versions, with very few differences. - Episode 9: Starts with an additional second of footage zoomed in on the Solaris's sail - Episode 27: Has a second of footage containing a lightning bolt omitted at the start of the Episode - Episode 29: In the Japanese version when Esteban Tao and Zia are struck by the Olmec ray, Esteban spins around much slower and the background isn't changed as much. - Closing Credits: There is an additional bit of animation used of the sun and then transitioning to Esteban's face - None of the previous, to follows, or live action documentaries are on the Japanese DVD's"

The other ending, however, is far different in that Carl Scott first runs into Ku Feng's character and the two of them fight first. Soon after, Bruce arrives and finds Carl tied to a tree still alive, rather than hanging dead from an overhanging branch. Aside from this, Feng's death is far more graphic showing a pseudo-X-Ray shot of Bruce's index finger buried into Feng's heart. Bruce then pulls his finger out, causing the heart to squirt out blood and then finally finishes off Feng with two fingers stabbing his throat, and Feng spitting out blood. Shortly after Feng falls dead to the ground, Carl runs over to Bruce and says \"Hey man, okay?\". The shot then freeze frames with Bruce and Carl looking off into the horizon with the end of the \"theme\" (Bill Conti's \"The Final Bell\" from Rocky) playing. While unconfirmed, it is likely the upbeat, albeit more violent, ending was used for the limited unrated US release (under the title Kung Fu Avengers) while the downbeat, but cut, ending was used originally for the wide R-rated US release (under the more popular title of Soul Brothers of Kung Fu) as well as the UK release."

These animations were replaced in the AIP re-edit by stills of some of the winged creatures. - The music score was changed - the new music was composed by Lex Baxter. Wilfred Joseph did the original score. - All topless nudity was removed from the AIP re-edit. This involved trimming several scenes and re-framing others (zooming in on the \"unoffensive\" part of the frame). This chopped about 3m off the running time. - The death of Essay Persson was abridged - In the middle section of the film some other scenes were re-positioned in the narrative with the intent of bringing forward the appearance of the coven (in order to speed up the narrative).

Instead the Earth based scene took place in a bowling alley. - The Command Center's interior had different control panels and lighting. - The plating on Alpha 5's upper torso was notably larger and didn't have the familiar \"lightning bolt\" logo. - 'Flyguy', renamed 'King Sphinx' for his eventual appearance in the TV series, appeared in the episode to battle the rangers with 'Goldar'. -The Dinozords were known as Dinodroids'. - There was a Bulk character, but no Skull character.

This version also ADDED one scene to the film that was not in the original 165 minute release, in which Harmonica gets up with a wounded arm after being shot in the opening scene. When it was run on U.S. network television, A.B.C. made edits to the 165 minute international version. Paramount's syndicated television version was also the international version (with edits).

However, the English audio is taken from the original pan and scan US video release under the title of \"Kung Fu Avengers\". The use of the German version explains why there are certain scenes missing, such as Feng's extended death scene, as well as additional bits that were cut throughout the film such as the deaths of Lee Hoi San's and Alexander Grand's characters. The \"alternate ending\" featured on the video is actually taken from the above mentioned \"Kung Fu Avengers\" video."

        "The differences as shown in the elongated TV version [indicated from a 1999 November showing on the Sci-Fi channel] are: - 1. Darkman (Arnold Vosloo) is introduced in the film immediately before the car chase; watching it from above. He then slides down a rope in front of a neon-lit sign. In a series of crosscutting, the car chase ensues as Darkman runs on rooftops. In the DVD/VHS version, Darkman is not introduced until after the car chase ends when the character Steve is shot; followed by a woman's scream. The shot of Darkman swinging down is never featured. The crosscutting of Darkman running only occurs as a gunman flees from the car wrecks. The TV version also features a shot of the policemen apprehending the immobilized gunman after Darkman's remark: \"Thanks for the donation.\" This single shot is absent from the DVD/VHS. - 2. After the scene where Peyton Westlake and Dr. David Brinkman (Jesse Collins) agree to be partners, Brinkman is seen waving off to a jetting Westlake replying solemnly, \"Partners...\" Directly afterward, a wide establishing tracking shot of Westlake's lab is featured. It then cuts to a medium shot of Westlake silently switching on a remote control. A radio is heard during these two shots reporting the weather. In the DVD/VHS version, none of this included. As Westlake jets out of Brinkman's lab, it cuts directly to a shot of Westlake's remote camera running across the floor with Westlake already at the controls. - 3. Westlake, once again in his lab, becomes enraged after reminiscing about what Dr. David Brinkman said to him before his murder. He screams savagely knocking objects off his desk, and then proceeds to run around his lab destroying additional objects. He is then interrupted by the TV's broadcast stating the name, \"Robert Durant...\" which features the character Jill Randall (Kim Delaney) and her live report. This then gives the motivation for Westlake to meet her. In the DVD/VHS version, this bit where he is interrupted by the TV is missing. - 4. When Westlake is confronted by Jill at the post office, the scene ends with a shot of her walking out the door and him in a close up holding up his scarred hands and then putting them to his face. This shot is missing in the DVD/VHS version. - 5. Before the scene where the character Eddie (David Ferry) is knocked out in the bathroom, a medium shot on a street corner shows Eddie stopping to look at his watch, and then him proceeding across the street with a silver briefcase. The shot eventually tilts up to reveal a large office building. In the DVD/VHS version, an exterior shot at the same street corner features the building, but no Eddie at all. It is a different shot because the traffic is not the same. - 6. When Darkman salutes Jill's photo seen on a TV in a store window, a shot shows him walk off with his cart further down to darker parts of the street as Randy Miller's musical score intensifies. The narration starts as the shot dissolves to a silhouette of Darkman looking out towards the city. In the DVD/VHS version, the narration starts at the shot of Darkman saluting, which then dissolves directly to the silhouette. - NOTE: Ordinarily, the intensely violent moments of the film are also removed to fit TV standards [depending on what that particular network allows]."

Interestingly, Dimension cut all references to the family have these kind of domestic issues with the daughter. - Following the first scene at the swimming pool, there is a brief scene where Regina is visited by her boyfriend Carlos ('Fele Martinez' (qv)) in the girls' locker room. They talk briefly about him coming over and she chastises him for sneaking into the locker room. A girl walks by in the background in a towel and no nudity is in the scene. When Mark ('Iain Glen' (qv)) is driving Paul ('Stephan Enquist' (qv)) to school, Paul asks, \"Are you and Mom going to split up?\" Mark responds by saying that \"only families that don't get along split up.\" - After Mark arrives home from the hospital, Regina has an argument with her mom on the front porch. The US version edits a section of dialogue where the mom says, \"If you don't like it here than you can just get your things together and go.\" - Following this fight, Regina visits Carlos in his apartment. She tells him about the argument while he develops photographs. - Following her father's row with the electrician, there is an extra scene where Regina returns to her room where Carlos is painting. He surprises her by taking a photograph (during the flash the ghost children are seen; it figures in later). She says to him, \"I'm staying.\" When Carlos asks why, Regina tells him not to ask her and only says, \"I can't leave now.\" - Regina and Carlos have additional dialogue before the scene where she tells him about her father condition at the swimming pool. She reiterates that he shouldn't ask her what is going on. - During Mark's second attack when he begins cutting the potatoes franticly with the knife, there are a series of flashes back to his past. After he cuts his hand, there are several close ups of the bloody hand and blood dripping onto the floor. - Two extra scenes appear back to back. One has Regina and Carlos in front of a computer looking up information and discovering \"Ouroboros\" and a website outlining some of the ritual. The other has the architect discovering the original letter with the design plans of the house while he is digging through papers. The US version cuts straight to Carlos and Regina in the library."

The Ultimate Edition also includes several deleted scenes: - when Conan and Subotai first enter the village, they are shown stopping by a vendor (played by director John Milius) selling lizard-on-a-stick. The vendor says, \"Want food? This is on a stick...fresh. Quick, there are many to feed!\" Shortly thereafter in the film, Conan remarks that the food is good, to which Subotai replies, \"You have no idea how long it's been there!\" - a scene of silhouettes on a wall fighting - a cut scene of King Osric being attacked and killed in his throne-room by (presumably) Doom's soldiers - another cut scene of King Osric's demise, shot from a different angle, which ends with him staring at the reflection of his dying self in a mirror astride the throne, which he then shatters with his sword before collapsing An outtake is also included that takes place just after Conan is freed from bondage, and is climbing the rocks leading to the Atlantean General's tomb, and is being pursued by wild dogs. As Arnold is climbing, one of the dogs reaches him, biting him, and a crew member runs on-screen to intervene as Arnold shouts \"Goddamnit!\" in pain."

Mai-Lee accidently hurts Kathryn while doing her toe nails and Kathryn yells at her in Vietnamese - a third scene is from the end of the movie, when Kathryn and Annette meet each other in the bathroom of Manchester. Only a minor change of dialogue takes place here though - finally and most interestingly there is the alternate ending scene. Sebastian still gets hit by a car, but not because of saving Annette. He just stops fighting when he sees her standing across the street and gets hit when he crosses it. This scene is probably changed to the version as it appears in the movie because his death is more heroic that way."

        "In December, 2003, the \"ALIEN QUADRILOGY\" box set was released with a newly created cut of \"Alien 3\" entitled 'the assembly cut.' It attempts to reconstruct David Fincher's workprint (which the studio balked at), but goes one step further and adds color correction, additional special effects and remixed 5.1 sound. Several scenes, however, suffer from poor on-set audio quality, mostly due to the use of fog machines and steam which obscures on-set dialog. Due to time and budget constraints, there was no time to re-record the dialogue for these scenes; optional subtitles transcript the dialog. It should be noted that the October 2010 \"ALIEN ANTHOLOGY\" Bluray boxset features the same 'assembly cut' as the 2003 DVD set. However, this time additional dialogue has been recorded, creating a soundtrack of more consistent quality, and making the addition of the deleted scenes all but seamless. Here are all of the found changes in the 'assembly cut': The scene of Ripley being rescued at the beginning is completely different. She is seen by Clements (Charles Dance) lying wahsed up on the beach and then taken into the prison, covered in dirt. A group of prisoners heads down to the beach with Oxen to get the EEV out of the water. In the theatrical print Ripley is discovered still inside her cryogenic unit inside the escape pod. This scene was re-shot to have footage of the dog (more on that later), and has no Oxen or scenes mentioned above. Various shots of people examining the escape pod that were in the theatrical print (as stated, they were taken from re-shoots made during post-production), including a shot of a facehugger crawling towards the dog and an elaborate optical shot of the EEV being carried out of the water by a crane (in the assembly cut it crashed right next to the shore), are missing from the DVD workprint. Immediately following the rescue sequence, 85 tells everyone in the mess hall to settle down, and Dillon preaches before Andrews' first 'rumor control.' The theatrical version started the scene directly with Andrews' rumor control. Just before the autopsy of Newt, there is a scene with Clemens, Ripley, and Prisoner Kevin walking down the spiral stairs into the morgue where Clemens questions Ripley about her need to certain Newt's death and also asks her if Newt was her daughter. Ripley denies this. As stated above, the alien comes out of an ox instead of a dog. There is a scene where two inmates are dragging an ox named babe after it has suddenly dropped dead into the butchery. They discuss what caused Babe's death, and they have some macho talk about Ripley. The scene ends when one of the inmates discovers a strange dead animal next to the ox's corpse (which is a dead Super facehugger). This scene replaces the scene in the theatrical cut where Murphy finds his wounded dog. The funeral scene is now intercut with scenes of the infant Alien bursting from the dead ox (originally it came out of the dog), concluding with a newly made digital shot of the Alien making its first steps and running off. Just before Ripley enters the mess Hall with her newly shaved head after the funeral, Prisoners Boggs and Rains share their complaints to Dillon about Prisoner Golic. They say he is crazy and smells bad, and that they don't want to work with him in the tunnels. Dillon tells them Golic is their brother and they should stop complaining. The scene in which Ripley and Dillon talk about temptations in the cafeteria ends on a shot of Dillon, where it originally ended on Ripley. Following Murphy's death, there is more dialog between Ripley and Clemens about why they had to cremate the bodies. Right after the scene where Ripley asks Clemens where the Bishop droid is, there is a scene where Dillon sees Boggs, Rains, and Golic, off on their excursion into the tunnels. Dillon asks them to light a candle for the dead prisoner Murphy (the first victim in the vent shaft). They go off into the tunnel. Immediately following this is the scene where Warden Andrews and Clemens meet to discuss Ripley. It has a completely new beginning, where the theatrical version begins with Andrews threatening Clemens, and ends with Andrews telling Clemens to \"sit the hell down.\" There is additional dialog here where Clemens explains to Andrews that Ripley was part of a combat team; Andrews eventually just tells Clemens to get out. Golic kicks open an old cigarette machine in the tunnel to get free cigarette packs. During Ripley's conversation with the reconnected Bishop, there are intercut scenes of a crazed and bloody Golic being found in the mess hall by Eric, the cook, who panics and drops the dishes. A little bit later, Golic is grabbed by the others (Clemens, 85, Andrews, and Dillon) and dragged to the infirmary. The scene following Andrews' talk with Ripley about the alien (where Ripley and Clemens talk) has a new opening shot in which the camera begins with a medium shot of Golic, then tracks through the hospital room. Later on in the scene, a tied up Golic interrupts with a few lines about how in an insane world, an sane man must appear to be insane; Clemens sarcastically thanks him. Golic spies on Ripley and Clemens talking by looking under the curtain. The alien drops from the air vent into the infirmary and lands on the mattress next to him causing it to 'lower'. There are more shots of it approaching, and Ripley sees it's feet through the bottom of the curtains. There is also a shot of the alien opening its mouth before killing Clemens. After the alien kills Clemens, and Ripley runs out of the infirmary, there is a close-up of Golic admiring the alien, he calls it \"magnificent.\" Followed by a shot of a large amount of blood dripping from the grate through which Clemens was hauled by the Alien (just after Ripley takes off for the dining hall). In the mess hall, Dillon leads a prayer and then chastises the prisoners for what has been going on (such as the attempted rape and the death of Murphy, Boggs, and Rains) as Ripley runs down the hallway. Andrews takes over with a sarcastic \"Thank you\" and the scene goes on as originally shown. A new shot where the prisoner mopping up Andrews' blood. He looks up at the air vent (an overhead shot). This is immediately followed by a new scene where Dillon preaches to the prisoners after Andrews' death. In the same scene after Morse says they should take Ripley's head and \"bash it through the fucking wall,\" Ripley replies \"That sounds good to me...\" There are several extra shots in the scene where the inmates set the trap in the tunnel (almost a minute's worth), including one with two inmates checking a pile of batteries, to see if there are some with enough electricity for Aaron's flashlight to work. Ripley looks exhausted while on paintbrush detail and shrugs it off, Dillon shows concern. As the explosions in the corridors are going off, there are several new shots of prisoners in the air vents engulfed in the flames and falling out of the vents on fire, as well as 85 running away from a burning prisoner. Dillon tries to activate the sprinkler to no effect (the sprinkler goes off in the theatrical version, and the scene ends right there). One of the prisoners is hurt badly and Ripley is trying to help him. The prisoner's friend Junior (the guy with the tear tattoo who initially attacks Ripley in the attempted rape scene) looks fearfully at her as she realizes both of them attacked her. The group runs for the spare sprinkler activator. The alien crawls down from the ceiling as the others (including Ripley and Dillon) try to lure it away. Junior is near the Toxic Waste room and sees a chance to trap the alien and runs into the room, causing the alien to run in after him and sacrificing his life. Ripley and Dillon lock the doors and the sounds of the alien killing him are heard outside. Dillon turns on the sprinklers. After finally putting out the fires, there are several new shots in the montage of prisoners walking through the wreckage of the hallways, and a scene where Dillon is leading a prayer for those who sacrificed themselves and died. Ripley and 85 look in from above and begin to discuss religion. 85 says that the company will arrive to kill the trapped alien with smart guns. Ripley asks him what to do if they won't kill it. Immediately following this, there is a scene where Morse is guarding the still bound Golic in the infirmary. Golic asks Morse to untie him, since his involvement in the killing of Boggs and Rains is no longer an issue. Morse reluctantly unties him, and after Golic asks him, tells him where the alien is trapped. Golic knocks him out and hurries out of the room. Next, there is a scene where 85 and Ripley are sending a transmission to the company about the trapped alien and Ripley, testing the company's intentions, requests permission to terminate the alien. The company quickly replies they are not to do anything against the alien, confirming Ripley's suspicions. Golic then arrives at the Toxic waste dump and tells the prisoner guarding the door he must talk to the creature. The prisoner shrugs him off and suddenly Golic slits his throat and opens the door, telling the alien he'll do anything he wants. Golic's screams as the alien attacks and runs away. Ripley then tells Dillon about the company's plans to keep the alien alive, which might jeopardize the entire universe. Dillon says he doesn't care about the rest of the universe. Ripley insists that innocent people will die and Dillon tells him that the world outside does not exist for them. Morse rushes in and tells them he has bad news. The three of them, along with 85 go to the dump where 85 blames Morse for the insane Golic's actions. Some of the latter scene was re-edited to make it follow the explosion sequence in the theatrical cut. A new scene in the assembly hall, after Ripley discovers she carries an Alien: the prisoners are arguing about the course of action to be taken; now that the Alien is free again, there is nothing stopping it from attacking them anywhere in the complex. One of the prisoners lights a match for his cigarette, which reminds all others of the Alien's fear of fire. They all decide to move to the furnace area immediately (which explains why Dillon's following 'peptalk' takes place there). When Ripley and 85 argue about contacting the company there is some extra dialog at the end of the scene. There is some added dialog in the scene where Ripley tells Dillon about the Queen inside of her, mainly about the nature of the Queen and the consequences of its survival. Also, when Ripley fights with Dillon after he refuses to kill her, there is an added line where Dillon says \"Go kill yourself\". During the scene where the remaining prisoners are meeting to discuss Dillon and Ripley's plan to terminate the alien, there are expanded dialog scenes concerning Dillon telling them they have a choice to get even with the creature for its destroying the others. Ripley then questions 85's statements that the rescue team is on its way. Some of the prisoners discuss religion before the tunnel sequence (right after Dillon says they are \"Praying\"). They laugh hysterically, which freaks out David (Pete Postlethwate). This replaces a scene where David is told by another prisoner named Jones what he's supposed to do. Jones leaves and David says to himself, \"This was her idea.\" Following this, there is a shot cut OUT of the assembly cut of 85 waiting for the rescue team. David (Pete Postlethwaite) finds Vincent's body in the tunnel. As the alien rampages through the tunnel, Ripley asks what the prisoners are doing (when two of them guarding the piston run off) and Dillon says \"Improvising\". There is more dialog when Bishop II confronts Ripley as he refers to the malignancy inside her and the great courage she has shown. There is also an added scene where the Asian medic explains the procedure to remove the alien from Ripley. When Bishop II asks Ripley to trust him and she must choose, the scene is more drawn out, and you can see Ripley agonizing more over the decision she must make. When 85 hits Bishop II with the pipe there is an additional moment which Bishop II can be seen in pain and wiping red blood from his face (adding more weight to the statement that he is indeed human and not an android. He shouts \"I'm not a droid!\" After this, Bishop sees one of his crew-members with a camera trying to film Ripley, and he tells the man with the camera, \"No pictures!\" Several shots of Ripley preparing for her jump, as she looks hesitant and nervous. She looks at Bishop and says \"You're crazy\" right before she jumps. Ripley's death scene is a completely alternate take: In the theatrical version, as Ripley falls, the alien queen burst out of her chest, here she simply falls into the lead. Her body can be seen burning up just before it hits the lead."

They are ambushed by Nazis, who kill the two spies before Cap finishes them all off. Cap then holds the dying female spy in his arms and is reminded of his girlfriend, Bernie, back in the United States. - There is an additional scene which explores the character of the Red Skull more, and it attempts to make him look much more like a tragic figure, haunted by his painful past. In the 1990's, as Steve Rogers is reviewing the deaths of Martin Luther King and John Kennedy and realizing that the Red Skull is to blame, the Red Skull is shown weeping over the piano seen at the end of the film, re-living the visitation of the Italian army storming into his house, shooting his family, and kidnapping him for their experiments. This scene shows that the Red Skull genuinely hates who he has become."

In addition, other restorations and corrections to the original broadcasts were made.

After its second post-premiere - the very next day - two scenes of 15 minutes total were deleted; making the film run its original world debut length at 181 minutes. One was a number called \"When My Sugar Walks Down the Street\" that came after Judy's take of \"I'll Get By\" in the 'Born in the Truck' sequence, the other was a scene where Garland and James Mason's characters (Vicki and Norman) were picnicking on the beach; production stills and promotional advertisements are the only thing left in existence of the footage. After its world premiere on September 29, 1954, 27 minutes was cut, bringing it down to a mediocre 154 time length. Those scenes were: 1) Esther quitting the band 2) The Trinidad Coconut Oil Shampoo 3) Esther working at a drive-in 4) Norman being driven away drunk in his car 5) Norman inquiring Esther's old landlady 6) Spotting Esther on the TV commercial 7) Tracking down Esther at her new boarding residence 8) Driving down the strip - Esther getting sick 9. \"Here's What I'm Here For\" musical number - Norman proposes 10. \"Lose That Long Face\" musical number - Vicki breaks down"

The other ending, however, is far different in that Carl Scott first runs into Ku Feng's character and the two of them fight first. Soon after, Bruce arrives and finds Carl tied to a tree still alive, rather than hanging dead from an overhanging branch. Aside from this, Feng's death is far more graphic showing a pseudo-X-Ray shot of Bruce's index finger buried into Feng's heart. Bruce then pulls his finger out, causing the heart to squirt out blood and then finally finishes off Feng with two fingers stabbing his throat, and Feng spitting out blood. Shortly after Feng falls dead to the ground, Carl runs over to Bruce and says \"Hey man, okay?\". The shot then freeze frames with Bruce and Carl looking off into the horizon with the end of the \"theme\" (Bill Conti's \"The Final Bell\" from Rocky) playing. While unconfirmed, it is likely the upbeat, albeit more violent, ending was used for the limited unrated US release (under the title Kung Fu Avengers) while the downbeat, but cut, ending was used originally for the wide R-rated US release (under the more popular title of Soul Brothers of Kung Fu) as well as the UK release."

Interesting what they chose to remove, considering that much of the animation itself could be seen by some as rather risqu\u00e9 and probably intended for an adult audience. The removed bits generally are those containing abuse by the conductor upon the orchestra and animator. This is the version that was theatrically released in the U.S..

But in the American film, the entire scene after the news bulletin part is cut out, which leads to an enormous amount of confusion. Until then the Germans had been making south for the US border; suddenly, with no explanation, they're shown hiking along the road headed west, only a few miles north of the border.

The changes occur in two scenes: - in the fight between Elektra and Bullseye the UK version lacks all sight of a dagger sticking through Elektra's hand and all sight of her removing the dagger from her hand. - Secondly, in the fight between Daredevil and Kingpin the UK version lacks a headbutt and has the sound of breaking bones partially obscured by a crack of thunder.

        "A 289min long workprint version exists. It has never been officially released but circulates as a video bootleg. The bootleg contains the following extra material not included in either the original theatrical release or the \"redux\" version. - A longer opening montage, the entire 10 minute song \"The End\" by The Doors is heard.It intercuts longer helicopters/jungle images with Willard in the hotel room in a drunken rage, as well as a scene where he is with a prostitute. There are various shots outside depicting the streets of Saigon. - When the two soldiers pick up Willard in the hotel room there is a brief conversation while they help him shower and shave. They notify him that his wait for his new mission is now over. - The scene where Willard is given his assignment is longer and contains much more dialogue. The general informs Willard that the mission is purely voluntary and he can decline it. The general also offers Willard a promotion to major upon completion of the mission. For some reason Colonel Kurtz is referred to in this scene as \"Colonel Leevy\". There are some external shots of the military base. - A brief scene where Willard is introduced to the crew of the Navy P.B.R. - Carmine Coppola's score is not present in this version. Many more songs by The Doors are played throughout the film instead. - None of the narration or dossier voiceovers are in this version. - There is no audio dubbing in this version. All the audio is from the sound recorded during the actual filming. Much of Robert Duvall's dialogue is unitelligable due to the sound of the helicopters in his scenes. - A much longer first cavalry \"Ride of Valkyrie\" attack scene (30+ mins)showing much unused footage and alternate takes. - A much longer playboy bunnies performance. - Various extended scenes on the boat, and alternate takes and shots. - A scene where a miniature toy boat passes the Navy PBR. Lance tries to grab it out of the water. The Chief yells at him to leave it alone claiming it's a booby trap. To prove it the Chief fires some shots at it to which it explodes. - When the P.B.R. reaches Do-lung bridge, the soldier that greets them gives a more detailed explanation of the chaos around the bridge. - When Lance is reading his letters on the boat, he suddenly stops to machine gun a water buffalo on the shore. The Chief yells at him to stop. - The sequence where Clean is killed is omitted. - A slightly longer French plantation sequence. After the French woman strips she crawls into the bed with Willard and they begin kissing. - The sequence where the Chief is killed is omitted. - More dialogue between Willard and the photojournalist when they first reach the Kurtz compound. The Journalist reveals that it was HE who was able to get the montangnards to break off their attack on the boat in the previous scene. Willard repeatedly asks the Journalists name but he refuses to answer. - The character of Colby, (the soldier who was sent before Willard to kill Kurtz, played by Scott Glenn) has a much more substantial role in this version. As Willard inspects the compound, Colby tells Willard that the night before, NVA soldiers had attacked (which explains all the bodies laying about the compound). Willard then enters Kurtz's house, much to the dismay of the journalist. Willard sees Kurtz empty bed and his medals, also his journal with the inscription \"Drop the bomb, exterminate them all\" (many of these scenes were in the final version but re-inserted in different places). - The scene where Willard talks to Chef about the air strike on the boat is omitted. - In this version. The first time Kurtz appears is the scene where a mud caked Willard is tied up (seated) to a pole in the rain. Kurtz appears with camouflage face paint, Willard asks....\"Why he is being mistreated?\" and tries to bluff his way past Kurtz by telling him that he had just completed a secret mission in Cambodia, and only stopped for supplies. Kurtz says nothing to him, but plants Chef's head in his lap. (Only a portion of this scene was in the original version). - The scene where Willard meets Kurtz in his bed chamber contains more dialogue....as Kurtz makes it clear that he knows why Willard is there. - A scene where Kurtz talks to Willard in the bamboo cage while two children sit on top of the cage and dangle insects in Willard's face. He tells him that Willard is \"like his colleagues in Washington, master liars who want to win the war but don't want to appear as immoral or unethical\". - A lengthy scene where the montangnards in a ritualistic display pick up the bamboo cage (with Willard inside) and poke him with sticks (Lance and Colby participate in this). The natives dance around the bamboo cage, chanting and singing while a squealing pig is tied up and killed. - A 10 minute version of the scene where Kurtz reads the poem \"The Hollow Men\", intercutting between his reading and the journalist talking with Willard. - A scene where the journalist meets Willard to tell him that he thinks Kurtz is about to kill him because he took his picture again. During which Colby comes behind the journalist and shoots him three times, killing him. Willard throws a knife at Colby's stomach to which he falls, but before he dies he asks Willard to talk to his family for him and asks him to kill Kurtz. - Kurtz speech about the horror and the children vaccination are omitted. - During the assassination scene at the end, before Willard enters Kurtz' home, one of the guards confronts him. Willard picks up a spear to defend himself as the guard picks up a child to shield himself. Willard runs the spear right through the child and into the guard. The final scene with Willard and the montangnards after Kurtz assasination are omitted."

Most notable of all is the live-action opening intro, in which shots of corpses during Chris' narration is replaced by newspaper pages, the decapitated hand found by Joseph is only shown briefly and Joseph's death scene (in which he fights shoots a zombie dog in the eye before being mutilated) was shortened. In addition, Chris was originally shown lighting a cigarette during the cast's introduction (this was replaced by superimposed colored footage of early shots of Chris from the intro). The second FMV movie altered was with the encounter with the first Zombie, in which showed Kenneth's half-eaten head is drop into the floor before the zombie himself faces the player. The third and final FMV that was change was Chris' \"bad\" ending, which was reshot so that Chris is no longer shown smoking (SCEA reportedly forbids any \"glorification\" of tobacco use in their games, despite the fact that SCEI has no problem with them).

In the work print he takes two bloody bullet hits in the back and then there is another shot of 3 more coming out of his chest and as he falls to the ground you can see another shot of him from behind taking another 3 hits before hitting the ground. - In the R rated version Evan is fired upon and doesn't appear to be hit until Frank finds him later. In the work print Kynette forces Travers shoot at Evan you then see Evan take a bullet through the shoulder in slow-motion which explains why he appears to have been shot when Frank finds him later on. - The fight between Gabe and Kynette has been shortened for the R rated version which misses shots of Gabe and Jessie being beaten further after Kynette asks for the *third* time where the money is (this is missing in the R rated version which leads to a continuity error as he said he would ask three times)The impaling of Kynette has been shortened, in the work print there is more focus on Kynette's eyes going back into his head and Gabe gritting his teeth holding Kynette up on the stalagmite as he is dying before finally dropping him. - When Hal and Delmar fight the R rated version has removed a shot of Delmar kicking Hal hard in the kidneys and saying \"Tell me how are we feeling so far?\" as opposed to the R rated version \"Tell me do you like soccer\" they have been edited together and this now explains why Delmar appears out of breath when he asks the soccer question. - When Hal shoots Delmar with the shotgun in the work print you see Craig Fairbrass get shot with a large splatter of blood behind him and a bloody shotgun wound to his chest as he dives off the mountain. The R rated version shows a different angle with a stuntman falling off the mountain. Additionally the work print shows Delmar's body slamming into the rocks below where as the R rated version cuts away just before. - When Qualen shoots Kristel in the work print all three bloody bullet impacts are shown, in the R rated version it cuts away after the first shot to show Traver's reaction. - The Gabe and Travers fight has been edited (this might not be censorship, apparently the filmmakers decided it would be better to have Gabe shoot Traver's with his piton gun before falling under the ice as per the R rated version) in the work print Gabe shoots Traver's once with the piton gun and Traver's gets up and tries to shoot Gabe through the ice and is then shot by Hal three times with a shotgun before falling under the ice (this explains why Hal appears with a shotgun in the R rated version). - The ending fight with Gabe and Qualen has been shortened so kidney punches, an arm break and a longer shot of a terrified Qualen crashing to his death in the helicopter were taken out."

This includes two excellent scenes cut from every version of the movie. At the beginning, as Arthur yells \"To the pit!\" the little bald guy with the whip (Gold Tooth) says \"To the pit with the blackguard!\" and charges Ash on his horse. Ash knocks him off the horse with his shotgun and is sucker-punched by Arthur, which Ash doesn't like, and knocks Arthur down. Arthur is shocked, but recovers to slap Ash's face lightly and order his men to \"Secure the prisoner.\" They do.  Another scene explains the mirror thing a little better, as Ash leaves the windmill to walk through an ominous forest, accidentally knocking into his horse. Saying \"You big piece of hamburger, c'mere,\" he ties the horse down until seeing a duplicate of himself in the windmill's doorway, which then slams shut. He runs back into the windmill and smashes headfirst into a mirror. These scenes are included in VERY rough scratched-up form in the \"director's cut\" DVD/VHS, along with another scene in which Ash is captured by Henry's men, including Rob Tapert. Henry stops them from killing Ash and laughs, calling Ash \"Mr. Fancypants.\" Ash convinces Henry to fight with him, saying \"You owe me.\" There is also an alternate opening on the DVD which is much more horror-like, omitting the S-Mart material and including more \"Evil Dead 2\"-style footage. This matches with the \"end of the world\" ending, as Ash appears to have a beard (only his eyes are shown to avoid giving this away too much)."
