In the Director's Cut, this scene runs longer, with Cindy asking Matrix about Jenny's mother, who Matrix says died in childbirth. He then laments how he has missed all the important moments of her life due to his work around the world. Cindy asks him why he had to do so much traveling, and what he did, to which he replies, \"Things you don't want to know about. Things that sometimes I wish I didn't know about. But that part of my life is over with, all that matters to me now is Jenny.\" - The tool-shed scene is longer, and contains several very brief new shots of soldiers being killed in various ways.

        "In 2007, 'Ridley Scott' (qv) released \"Blade Runner: The Final Cut\", digitally remastered with improved visual and sound effects, and with numerous revisions to the 1992 Director's Cut. The more noticeable differences between The Director's Cut and The Final Cut include: - The overall film has been brightened considerably, revealing previously hidden details in many shots. Additionally, the digital enhancement reveals many heretofore obscured details, such as dirty dishes in Deckard's apartment and a freeway high above Pris as she approaches the Bradbury. - The opening credits have been completely redone, although in the exact same font as in the original film. The noticeable shimmer effect from the theatrical cut and the Director's Cut has been removed. - In the opening shot, the flames shooting up have been re-animated to look more synchronized with the associated light play on the smokestacks. - In the shots of the staring eye, you can briefly see the pupil react to the setting of 2019 L.A. - A couple of shots were trimmed (such as Deckard's intro reading the newspaper). - Additional smoke was added behind the cook when Gaff ('Edward James Olmos' (qv)) and a police officer are talking to Deckard while he is eating at the White Dragon. - All spinner wires have been removed and matte lines erased. - Bryant's ('M. Emmet Walsh' (qv)) line \"I've got four skin jobs walking the streets\" has been improved so it's not obviously an inserted recording. - Bryant says that \"2\" replicants were fried in the electrical field (as opposed to the theatrical release and Director's Cut, where he says only 1 was killed). - Bryant describes Leon's job during the incept tapes scene. - New Cityspeak and other chatter comes over on the police scanner in Gaff's spinner rides both to the police station and the Tyrell building. - The original shot of Roy ('Rutger Hauer' (qv)) in the VidPhone booth that had been recycled from the later confrontation with Tyrell ('Joe Turkel' (qv)) has been digitally altered so that it truly does look like Roy was in the booth. The thumb on his shoulder has also been digitally removed from the shot. - The hotel manager mutters \"Kowalski\" as he opens the door to Leon's ('Brion James (I)' (qv)) room for Deckard and Gaff. - The new Unicorn footage is longer and shows Deckard to be awake during the sequence. This is how Ridley Scott and editor 'Terry Rawlings' (qv) originally conceived of the scene. Deckard is shown staring into space, and there is a cut to the unicorn. The film then cuts back to Deckard and again cuts back to the unicorn, before returning to Deckard once more. The shot of the unicorn which appeared in the Director's Cut has also been recolored, and the sound mix has been completely redone. - The blue grid lines on the Esper machine have been reanimated, to make them look less smooth. - When Deckard finds Zhora lying down in the back room on the photo, the image is now that of 'Joanna Cassidy' (qv); previously, it was clearly someone else. - New footage of the LA streets before Animoid Row and Taffy Lewis's club, including the hockey-masked geisha dancers. - The serial number on the snake scale now matches the Animoid Row lady's dialog. - There is a shot of Deckard asking for directions to Taffy Lewis' from a uniformed policeman. - The lip flap between Deckard and Abdul Ben Hassan has been digitally corrected (using 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv)'s son, Ben, as a stand-in for his mouth movements). - In Zhora's death scene, you can tell it is her the entire time; previously it was obvious that her stunt double, 'Lee Pulford' (qv), was in the shot. Joanna Cassidy's head was digitally superimposed over Pulford's. - Deckard's cut after retiring Zhora was digitally removed (it wasn't supposed to be there until after the fight with Leon). - The marquee inconsistencies on the Million Dollar Theatre have been corrected. - During Roy's confrontation with Tyrell, he says, \"I want more life, father\", as opposed to \"I want more life, fucker\". - When Roy kills Tyrell, the footage is the same as that found in the International Cut, with the additional violence. Additionally, when Roy turns to Sebastian, he says \"I'm sorry, Sebastian. Come. Come\", as he walks towards him. - When Pris ('Daryl Hannah' (qv)) attacks Deckard, she reaches down and grabs him by the nostrils - When Deckard shoots Pris, he shoots 3 times instead of 2. - The two shadows (of Ridley Scott and 'Jordan Cronenweth' (qv)) seen on the wall during the chase sequence have been removed. - When Roy pushes the nail through his hand, there is a shot of the nail coming through the skin on the other side. - When Roy releases the dove, it now flies up into a background that matches 2019 L.A. - The music which plays over the end credits is a newly composed piece by 'Vangelis' (qv); a different version of the 'End Credits' theme as heard in all other cuts. - In the closing credits, 'David L. Snyder' (qv) is now listed as 'David L. Snyder', instead of 'David Snyder'. Additionally, 'Ben Astar' (qv) is now credited for playing the role of Abdul Ben Hassan.",

On the other hand, the MSX version is more of an exploration game, requiring player to find keys to clear stages and having to purchase their power-ups from merchants. The level designs and some of the enemies are different as well. The MSX version uses the same sprites as the Famicom version (with more colors), but with different backgrounds.

        "Lions Gate cut 2 minutes from the film for the US Theatrical Release. However, the uncut version did play at a few festivals before Lions Gate bought it. This version is available as a bootleg. A full list of scenes cut are: - The scene where they are in the shop in the beginning is removed from the \"uncut\" version and is replaced with an extended scene of them driving the truck through the woods. Then they stop when Burt says he left something back at the store and they have a longer conversation about the map. - The scene of Rider Strong going behind the building to wash his hands after Dennis's bite and he pets the stray dogs is removed from the \"uncut\" version. - A different angle of Jordan Ladd's character Karen swimming away after the \"kiss\" scene on the dock with Rider Strong. - When it is discovered that Karen has the disease during an intimate scene, there is an additional scene that follows the \"Don't...Leave...Me!\" where Burt comes into the room and yells at her about how the truck isn't ready yet, and they have to finish cleaning up the bum's blood. - An extended scene of everyone arguing around the fireplace when Burt makes a joke about his burnt marshmallow. - A scene of Burt sitting outside guarding the shed with his shot gun. This immediatly follows when they hear the dog trying to get Karen in the shed and they shoot a bullet and tell Karen that they will stay outside with her to keep the dog away. - The gunshot to Burt's head in the cabin is bloodier. In the \"R\" rated version it cuts away quick and only shows the aftermath from a difficult-to-see angle. - An additional scene where Rider Strong grabs the long-haired hick after the attack and drags him down to the celler. He yells at the hick as he throws him down there and says \"When they get here, tell them I didn't do it!\", then slams the door. - The human-bonfire scene when they say \"We got another one in the basement\" immediatly goes to a shot of the celler door opening from the inside, then a bunch of shotguns appear and start shooting like crazy. We see blood all over the walls. Then they pour gasoline and one cop lights a match and celler goes up in flames followed by more shots of blood and guts on the walls, ceiling, and floor. - The end is switched around a little. Instead of just the cops drinking the contaminated lemonade followed by a country song with the townspeople, the whole entie town shows up and has a cup. There is additional dialoug amoung the townspeople, different shots, and it shows the FDA man walking around more testing and the Water supply truck is in view longer. - That is every scene that is changed or cut from the Lions Gate release.",

It then adds new footage of Batman and Catwoman fighting. It then cuts to Barbara Gordon's apartment, intercut with footage of her fighting. It cuts directly from her in the shower to her opening the door, where she is shot by Joker. The whole thing has new narration by Alfred Pennyworth. - The most obvious difference is that Harley Quinn was recast.

(0:47) - More graphic detail in the bloodletting scene. - Brief shot of Duan caressing Juxian's cheek, right after Cheng and Yuan makeup scene. - After our first glance of Cheng smoking opium, right before Cheng and Duan visit their old teacher. Cheng steps out of his home, smoking and looking quite listless. He chokes as a car passes. Then we see Juxian showing a group of Duan's friends to the exit of their home, recovering money that her husband has lent them. Juxian complains that Duan doesn't have a real job; Duan responds that all he can do is sing, and Juxian has forbidden that. Juxian mentions that Duan and Cheng's old teacher wants to see them; Duan says that he is too ashamed to face him. (2:02) - After Juxian visits Cheng in his cell, just before trial. Beginning of the trial dialogue cut, where Peking Opera is described as \"pornographic music\", and the formal charges of collusion with the Japanese Officer, Aoki, are described. (0:43) - Later, in the same trial scene, after Na's \"testimony\", Yuan objects to the idea of Peking Opera as \"pornographic music\".  (1:01) - After the communists march into Beijing, Cheng and Duan are performing \"Farewell\" to an audience of communist troops. The troops do not respond, and then break into a patriotic song afterwards. Xiao Si seems to take to their philosophy. This scene cuts into what seems to be one large crowd scene in the U.S. release -- everything depicting Xiao Si (the foundling) skipping through the streets of Beijing comes after this scene. (1:52) - After Juxian's suicide, and before we cut to the present day, we get a short scene where the traitorous Xiao Si seems to get his due. He is sitting alone with the case of jewelry given Cheng by Yuan, and singing from \"Farewell\". Behind him, communist troops begin to file in, and Xiao Si is startled to see them in the mirror. One of them approaches and hands him what seems to be some sort of summons. (1:11)",

However, Sega, the publisher of the game, thought the scene was a little too risky to release out for the Western audience.

Jeffrey also meets Sandy for the first time at the house. - An extended scene of Jeffrey with Dorothy in her apartment after Frank Booth leaves and finding another severed human ear in the bathroom sink. - An argument between Jeffrey and Sandy over his continued obsession in the Dorothy Valens case. - A rooftop scene during Jeffrey's second visit to Dorothy where she confides in him about her messed up life and wants to throw herself off the roof of the building. But Jeffrey stops her and they kiss for the first time. - A dinner scene where Jeffrey has dinner with Sandy and her parents where her boyfriend Mike joins them and grows suspicious at the table of the relationship between Sandy and Jeffrey. - A very surreal scene at the seedy nightclub \"This Is It\" where Frank and his three henchmen take Jeffrey and Dorothy through the dark, dimly lit place filled with topless waitresses, one of the lights her nipples on fire. Frank then beats up a man and throws him across a pool table for not fixing his jacket pockets for he \"lost his trophy.\" This explains how Jeffrey found the missing ear in the field behind the hospital, it apparently fell through a hole in Frank's jacket pocket. - A final epiloge scene at the police station where Jeffrey and Sandy give their statements to the press of the case and of Williams explaining that they found Dorothy's young son at the nightclub, Frank's henchmen are dead after the shootout at the warehouse, and the nightclub owner Ben and a few others have been aprehended at the club during the raid.",

        "When Blind Fury was being prepared for TV in the early 90s, many changes were made to the finished film, adding short extensions here and there, as well as alternate \"TV friendly\" takes of various lines. Here's the full list of changes: 1. Alternate take: Billy sticks his tongue out at Nick to \"test\" his blindness, rather than giving him the finger as in the theatrical cut. 2. Deleted shot: Billy runs outside along his backyard pool, with a tracking shot revealing more of his dinosaur sculptures 3. Extended scene: Lynn mentions Frank not discussing the war, prior to Nick pouring the tea (thus, the \"he never even talked about the war\" line is removed later on). She later further expresses the difficulties of divorce. 4. Extended shot: After the cop at the bus station checks on Nick and Billy, the shot continues well after they leave, with the cop still staring. Due to a deleted scene later, the \"I get the window seat...\" line is removed. 5. Deleted scene: Nick goes to the cashier at the bus station to buy two tickets to Reno, only for the cashier (realizing Nick is blind) to try to trick him by giving him less change. Nick, aware of this, points out the mistake, and also knocks off the cashier's toupee onto a Slurpee. It's at the end of this scene where we actually see Billy say the \"I get the window seat...\" line. 6. Deleted scene: When Nick and Billy first begin their bus trip, it initially begins with Billy using his inhaler, later to use it to wake Nick up. Billy then continually complains that he can't sleep on the bus, with Nick bluntly replying with \"then don't\". This scene takes place prior to Annie visiting Frank, and temporarily replaces the scene with Billy flopping around and hitting Nick on the bus as he sleeps. This latter scene instead is placed after the Annie/Frank scene in the TV cut. 7. Deleted shot: Prior to the bus scene with Nick telling Billy about his father, there's an extra shot of the bus driving into Graceland, complete with a \"Home of Elvis Presley\" sign. 8. Deleted scene: In the middle of Nick's chase after Billy in the cornfield, he actually manages to stop him at one point, with Billy exclaiming the fact that his mother's dead and his father doesn't want him. 9. Extended scene: At the end of the scene with Nick and Billy by the campfire, when Billy attempts to \"see\" what Nick's life is like by closing his eyes, he hears footsteps, only to discover a nearby deer. Nick asks Billy to describe it, and he responds saying it's \"like a real deer... not like in a zoo.\" And that it also looks \"free.\" 10. Extended scene: When Nick and Billy are trapped in the back of Lyle and Tector's van, there's an additional segment in which Billy looks around saying \"It's so dark in here\". Nick, sarcastically, simply replies \"I thought it was just me.\" 11. Alternate take: After Lyle and Tector steal the car from the two old women and shoot out the back window, the TV cut uses a take of Lyle exclaiming \"What the?\" as opposed to the theatrical cut's \"Jesus H. Christ!\" 12. Deleted shot: After the alternate \"What the?\" take, the film cuts back to the two old women, with the unarmed woman saying to the armed one \"You always forget to reload!\" 13. Alternate take: When the driver that Nick nearly runs off the road realizes the Nick is blind, he exclaims \"Holy cow!\" rather than the theatrical cut's \"Holy shit!\" 14. Deleted shot: When Annie sees Nick off to find Frank, she tells him that she thinks Frank was set up by MacReady. 15. Extended scene: After Nick leaves Billy and Annie to find Frank, Annie asks Billy \"What did he say to you?\" Billy says \"To hold down the fort and protect the women.\" Annie responds with \"It's good to know we're in such capable hands Billy. In as deep a voice as he can muster, Billy says \"It's Bill.\" 16. Deleted scene: After Nick escapes from the casino riot to the elevator, there's an additional scene in which he starts eating the food off of the room service tray, as well as dropping his cigar into the coffee pot. 17. Alternate take: When Nick disables the elevator that Lyle and Tector are riding in, rather than the theatrical cut's \"Shit! Fuck! Shit fuck!\", the TV cut uses a far more tame \"Dog! Gone! Dog gone!\" 18. Alternate take: When Nick asks Cobb where Frank is, the theatrical cut has Cobb respond with \"F.O., Errol Flynn. Do you know what that means? Fuck off!\". However, the TV cut dubs in the line \"G.T.H., Errol Flynn.\" in the same two-shot used in the theatrical cut, but uses new footage on the close up on Cobb, with his alternate response of \"Do you know what that means? Go to Hell!\" 19. Deleted scene: After Nick knocks out Cobb and takes the key, the TV cut jumps to an extra short scene in which the Casino guards try to push Lyle into the elevator shaft, only for him to crash back down. Tector then asks \"You okay?\" 20. Extended scene: When Nick and Frank try to find Annie and Billy, there's a long take of Frank asking \"anybody home?\" before searching the inside of the modified bus. This cuts to a longer POV shot of Frank walking through the bus. 21. Deleted shot: After Frank makes the deal on the phone with MacReady, there's an additional shot of Frank exclaiming \"What I wouldn't give!\" and then calming down to say to Nick \"I guess you don't get any second chances, though, do you?\" 22. Alternate take: At the end of the Winterhaven ambush scene, an alternate angle/take of Nick stabbing Cobb is used, in which the bloodied blade and the final stab aren't as prominent as they are in the theatrical cut. 23. Deleted scene: Before Nick and Frank make their way to meet MacReady, Frank steps in saying \"Nick, this way!\" 24. Extended ending: As Billy tries to stop Nick from leaving, the overall scene is longer, with Nick saying that Billy is becoming a man and that he promises that he will call and see him again. This version rarely appears on TV anymore, but was more recently spotted on Reelz Channel.",

(This explains Slide's arrest later in the movie for 37 parking tickets.) - The first scene in the locker room has Lonnie, Hippo and Chuco getting into their work clothes while listing to the radio about a bombing by the Mad Pop Bottle Bomber, and Charlie walks in coughing and Hippo comments on Charlie's cough. - Snapper arriving for work and meeting Earl a.k.a.: Mr. Clean getting out his car and removing a polisher from the trunk. - A scene at Big Joe's Dog House next door to the car wash with Joe (Danny DeVito) arguing with Terry (Brooke Adams) about her looking at another guy while parked at a stoplight on their way to work. - Another scene at Big Joe's with Joe aruguing with Terry about the work they do while planing breakfast for the first customers. - The montage of washing cars has some scenes with Marsha putting on more makeup and hairspray in place of the shots of Irwin smoking pot in the mens room and Goody walking in on him. - The scene where Earl talks to the Oldsmobile owner is extended with Earl offering to polish the man's car and offers $18.50 for the job which will last four hours, and the car owner finally agrees. - A scene where Irwin sees a plate danish pastries and takes one which his father Mr. B, tense and worried about everything, takes it away and chases him away.  While Mr. B is talking to Marsha about an obituarry of a friend dying, Irwin returns and takes the entire plate of danish away to the pinball room to eat them. - A shot of the hooker in the ladies room looking at her self in another fashion with a brunette wig, she decides she does not like it and begins changing into another fashion. - A scene at Big Joe's where Terry is talking to two policemen about her and Joe seeing the movie \"Carrie\" the other night, the mailman Barney arriving with Joe's mail, and Joe telling the policemen that the coffee they are drinking is 70 cents with their dounuts.  One cop balks saying that Terry gives them coffee for free.

Marsha is crushed but has no choice but to accompany them for their evening out. - More dialogue between Justin and Snapper, his grandfather, while they are waiting for the bus where Loretta arrives and Justin says hi to her before going back to Snapper and tells him that he's going to get a ride with her.",

Originally the character of Marcy, played by Lindsay Sloane, was a red-headed bulemic who got her job because her uncle was a studio executive. Spelling took offense and thought that it was a reference to his daughter Tori Spelling who was a star on \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" a series created by Darren Star and produced by Aaron Spelling. Before the pilot aired Star took out all references to how Marcy got her job, a scene in which Marcy threw up in a limo and even went as far as to digitally alter her hair so that it was brown and not red. Joely Fisher, who played producer Hope Lustig, was originally credited in the opening titles but was removed after the first episode when she decided to leave the show to work on \"Normal, Ohio\" a sitcom which was canceled.

This version has the following scenes reinstated: - A guardsman named Mr. Widdenfield (played by Arthur Malet) harasses Captain Greer, while Mrs. Hobday tries to clear things out (leading into the song \"The Old Home Guard\"). - A Home Guard sergeant asking for permission to dismiss the marching parade (immediately after \"The Old Home Guard\" ends). - Mr. Jelk tells Mrs. Hobday of his plans to buy Miss Price's house. - At dinner time, Carrie tells Miss Price she and her brothers are orphans, while she explains what happened to their caretaker, Aunt Bessie. - Miss Price notes mango-wurzel jam is available at the dinner table, and they say grace, as the children look disgusted at Miss Price's tastes in food. - Miss Price tells the children no one has ever seen her workroom before. - As Mr. Jelk brings a letter to Miss Price (the one that informs her the Emelius Browne Correspondence College of Witchcraft has closed), he tries to get into the house and talk to her, but she politely sends him away. - When Miss Price asks Paul for the bedknob back to get to London, Charlie attempts to extort some money from her, but she rebuffs him. - After \"The Age of Not Believing,\" Paul tries to get the bed to fly, but Miss Price forgot to tell him to tell the knob where to take them. - When the children find Mr. Browne on the streets of London, they take the bed with them and follow him. - The entire song \"With a Flair\" and its lead-in, as well as Mr. Browne's subsequent offer to sell his magic props. - When Miss Price says \"we'd be delighted [to join Mr. Browne for luncheon],\" Mr. Browne asks if the children belong to her. - At the townhouse where Mr. Browne is staying, Miss Price explains to her what substitutiary locomotion is and why she wants the spell. - The second nursery scene, in which Paul discovers the book \"Isle of Naboombu,\" is put before \"Eglantine\", whereas it was formerly after it. - The song \"Eglantine\" is restored to its entirety. - The song \"Portobello Road\" is restored to its entirety, as its subsequent dance sequence. The main song adds a scene with a used clothing merchant and another scene where Charlie and Paul play cricket. In the dance, the Caribbean dance now precedes the Irish dance. Unlike the rest of the formerly cut scenes, the tail end of the Irish dance and the beginning of the dance's climax only existed as a faded work-print that had to be digitally scanned and cleaned before it could be brought back to a passable state. - Mr. Browne tells Swinburne that the bed once belonged to royalty and is being offered to the Bookman as a present, while the children push the bed through the door. - Mr. Browne rebuffs the Bookman's offer to swap sections of the book, but relents when he is threatened. - A scene in the village store where Mrs. Hobday meets Mr. Browne and suggests he should marry Miss Price. Mr. Jelk walks in and overhears them. - The song \"Nobody's Problem's for Me\" is reinstated after Mr. Browne leaves the house. No orchestral track existed, so the studio recorded a new one.",

Some of the missing scenes include: - Bryant's line \"Don't be an asshole Deckard\" was changed to \"Don't be an ass Deckard\". - The word \"Christ\" was cut from Byrant's line \"Christ Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you left on the sidewalk\" - The word \"goddamn\" was cut from Bryant's line \"He's a goddamn one man slaughter house.\" - All scenes showing Zhora's breasts have been removed. - Roy's line, \"I want more life fucker/father\" was changed to \"I want more life\". - Roy's murder of Tyrell is much shorter than in all other versions. - The fight between Pris and Deckard is heavily edited; all shots of Pris thrashing on the ground after being shot were cut, as were all the scenes where Deckard's head is trapped between her legs.",

Nugent runs upstairs to stop Torres. After Jack tells the ADA he's willing to testify, Torres shoots him when he pulls the tape recorder from his pocket just as Nugent reaches him. They both fall down the stairs. But then Nugent moves as the playback starts on the tape recorder. The ADA rushes to the jury with the recording as someone covers Jack's face with a blanket. Later a voice over (when Diane gets the cake) by Eddie reveals that Diane came to see him in Seattle to tell him that Jack is dead.",

        "A 289min long workprint version exists. It has never been officially released but circulates as a video bootleg. The bootleg contains the following extra material not included in either the original theatrical release or the \"redux\" version. - A longer opening montage, the entire 10 minute song \"The End\" by The Doors is heard.It intercuts longer helicopters/jungle images with Willard in the hotel room in a drunken rage, as well as a scene where he is with a prostitute. There are various shots outside depicting the streets of Saigon. - When the two soldiers pick up Willard in the hotel room there is a brief conversation while they help him shower and shave. They notify him that his wait for his new mission is now over. - The scene where Willard is given his assignment is longer and contains much more dialogue. The general informs Willard that the mission is purely voluntary and he can decline it. The general also offers Willard a promotion to major upon completion of the mission. For some reason Colonel Kurtz is referred to in this scene as \"Colonel Leevy\". There are some external shots of the military base. - A brief scene where Willard is introduced to the crew of the Navy P.B.R. - Carmine Coppola's score is not present in this version. Many more songs by The Doors are played throughout the film instead. - None of the narration or dossier voiceovers are in this version. - There is no audio dubbing in this version. All the audio is from the sound recorded during the actual filming. Much of Robert Duvall's dialogue is unitelligable due to the sound of the helicopters in his scenes. - A much longer first cavalry \"Ride of Valkyrie\" attack scene (30+ mins)showing much unused footage and alternate takes. - A much longer playboy bunnies performance. - Various extended scenes on the boat, and alternate takes and shots. - A scene where a miniature toy boat passes the Navy PBR. Lance tries to grab it out of the water. The Chief yells at him to leave it alone claiming it's a booby trap. To prove it the Chief fires some shots at it to which it explodes. - When the P.B.R. reaches Do-lung bridge, the soldier that greets them gives a more detailed explanation of the chaos around the bridge. - When Lance is reading his letters on the boat, he suddenly stops to machine gun a water buffalo on the shore. The Chief yells at him to stop. - The sequence where Clean is killed is omitted. - A slightly longer French plantation sequence. After the French woman strips she crawls into the bed with Willard and they begin kissing. - The sequence where the Chief is killed is omitted. - More dialogue between Willard and the photojournalist when they first reach the Kurtz compound. The Journalist reveals that it was HE who was able to get the montangnards to break off their attack on the boat in the previous scene. Willard repeatedly asks the Journalists name but he refuses to answer. - The character of Colby, (the soldier who was sent before Willard to kill Kurtz, played by Scott Glenn) has a much more substantial role in this version. As Willard inspects the compound, Colby tells Willard that the night before, NVA soldiers had attacked (which explains all the bodies laying about the compound). Willard then enters Kurtz's house, much to the dismay of the journalist. Willard sees Kurtz empty bed and his medals, also his journal with the inscription \"Drop the bomb, exterminate them all\" (many of these scenes were in the final version but re-inserted in different places). - The scene where Willard talks to Chef about the air strike on the boat is omitted. - In this version. The first time Kurtz appears is the scene where a mud caked Willard is tied up (seated) to a pole in the rain. Kurtz appears with camouflage face paint, Willard asks....\"Why he is being mistreated?\" and tries to bluff his way past Kurtz by telling him that he had just completed a secret mission in Cambodia, and only stopped for supplies. Kurtz says nothing to him, but plants Chef's head in his lap. (Only a portion of this scene was in the original version). - The scene where Willard meets Kurtz in his bed chamber contains more dialogue....as Kurtz makes it clear that he knows why Willard is there. - A scene where Kurtz talks to Willard in the bamboo cage while two children sit on top of the cage and dangle insects in Willard's face. He tells him that Willard is \"like his colleagues in Washington, master liars who want to win the war but don't want to appear as immoral or unethical\". - A lengthy scene where the montangnards in a ritualistic display pick up the bamboo cage (with Willard inside) and poke him with sticks (Lance and Colby participate in this). The natives dance around the bamboo cage, chanting and singing while a squealing pig is tied up and killed. - A 10 minute version of the scene where Kurtz reads the poem \"The Hollow Men\", intercutting between his reading and the journalist talking with Willard. - A scene where the journalist meets Willard to tell him that he thinks Kurtz is about to kill him because he took his picture again. During which Colby comes behind the journalist and shoots him three times, killing him. Willard throws a knife at Colby's stomach to which he falls, but before he dies he asks Willard to talk to his family for him and asks him to kill Kurtz. - Kurtz speech about the horror and the children vaccination are omitted. - During the assassination scene at the end, before Willard enters Kurtz' home, one of the guards confronts him. Willard picks up a spear to defend himself as the guard picks up a child to shield himself. Willard runs the spear right through the child and into the guard. The final scene with Willard and the montangnards after Kurtz assasination are omitted.",

We learn now that he wasn't wearing a bathing suit - another scene shows Kathryn getting mad at her housekeeper, Mai-Lee. Mai-Lee accidently hurts Kathryn while doing her toe nails and Kathryn yells at her in Vietnamese - a third scene is from the end of the movie, when Kathryn and Annette meet each other in the bathroom of Manchester. Only a minor change of dialogue takes place here though - finally and most interestingly there is the alternate ending scene. Sebastian still gets hit by a car, but not because of saving Annette. He just stops fighting when he sees her standing across the street and gets hit when he crosses it. This scene is probably changed to the version as it appears in the movie because his death is more heroic that way.",

Instead the Earth based scene took place in a bowling alley. - The Command Center's interior had different control panels and lighting. - The plating on Alpha 5's upper torso was notably larger and didn't have the familiar \"lightning bolt\" logo. - 'Flyguy', renamed 'King Sphinx' for his eventual appearance in the TV series, appeared in the episode to battle the rangers with 'Goldar'. -The Dinozords were known as Dinodroids'. - There was a Bulk character, but no Skull character.

They are: A small sub-plot in which Luis Guzman's character (maurice) bugs Rollergirl throughout the film for nude pictures of her. He sends the pictures back to his brothers in Puerto Rico. This ties in with the deleted scene between him and Rollergirl. A scene in which Alfred Molina's character (Rahad) runs back to the house after chasing Dirk and Reed with the gun. Cosmo has been shot, and is dead. Helicopters circle, and he is actually happy he gets to use his firepower. He exchanges shots with cops, and ultimately dies in the confrontation. Becky Barnett's husband abuses her shortly after they are married, and she calls Dirk over to help her. He wrecks his car in the way, which explains the damage to his car seen in the movie.",

The 2007 release by Allumination Filmworks has a total running time of 50:03 (including 00:30 of production clips) and was probably shortened for release on commercial television in an hour long time slot. Both DVDs list a running time of \"approximately 60 minutes\". The Allumination version was created by cutting 05:51 out of the Bonneville feature; the longest cut (02:42) begins in the \"Twinkie\" scene when Jess promises May Belle that he will get even with Janice Avery for eating May Belle's Twinkie, continuing through Leslie and Jess forging a letter to Janice from Willard Hughes, through Jess putting the letter in Janice's desk, through Jess seeing puppies being given away for free, through Leslie telling Jess that Janice is in the bathroom crying, and stopping just before Leslie tells Jess why Janice is crying.

The film sat on a shelf for almost 25 years until actress Lea Lander rescued it from oblivion by helping finance a DVD release: a new short prologue was shot, according to Bava's original script, and editing and scoring were completed using existing available materials.  In 2002 producer Alfredo Leone and director Lamberto Bava (Mario's son), allegedly dissatisfied with the DVD edit, produced a new restored version of the film.  Lamberto Bava and his son Roy shot additional footage and original composer Stelvio Cipriani created a new complete musical score (though the DVD release employed some of Cipriani's cues and themes, the film was never properly scored in 1974).  This restored version, produced by Kismet Entertainment Group and retitled \"Kidnapped\", premiered theatrically in the US on May 31, 2002 as part of a Mario Bava retrospective at the American Cinematheque's Egyptian Theater in Hollywood",

        "Several scenes (most of which can be read in the film's script) were shot but removed or altered for various reasons, either for content or to keep the running time under two hours. These scenes are, in chronological order: - The earliest versions had Clyde shooting and killing the butcher during their fight. This was toned down to Clyde just shooting the butcher, and finally just pistol whipping him. In real life, speculation still exists as to whether 'Clyde Barrow' (qv) actually committed the crime this is based on; although his photo was picked out, the method in which it was executed doesn't fit his MO. In the final cut, there is a brief jump in the film during the fight, where it was spliced from the original, more graphic conclusion. - After picking up C.W., Clyde and Bonnie take him to a diner where they plan their next robbery. - After Clyde kills Doyle Johnson (the man on the running board), Bonnie talks with CW in the bathroom while Clyde cleans his guns and laments his actions. In the bathroom CW bathes and Bonnie attempts to seduce him, but changes her mind when CW proves to be less than romantic material. A still from this scene-- Bonnie wearing a slip and Clyde's hat-- can be seen on the DVD. - A longer scene of Buck and Blanche's approach to the motor lodge. Buck is singing Bible hymns and Blanche scolds him for bringing her to see Clyde. - A longer version of Bonnie's visit home; she sits in the car and her sister gives her a perm (a portion of this-- Bonnie on the running board getting her hair put up-- exists in the final film). - A very long sequence in which Bonnie and Clyde get drunk and come to terms with their impending death. They trash their room and rip out the mattress from their bed, turning it into a makeshift coffin. They then put on their best clothes and put makeup on each other so they can see what they will look like when they're dead. The scene concludes with Bonnie and Clyde dancing around CW by candlelight and chanting \"The Hearse Song.\" - During the Platte City raid, C.W. uses a machine gun to attack the armored car instead of grenades. - The final shootout, in it's earliest form, was done entirely with still photos shown over sounds of machine gun fire and screams, and we never actually saw Bonnie or Clyde dead. The movie ended with the two farmers running towards the car while \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\" Played in the background.",

        "CBS Television Network in the United States refused to carry the episode \"Living in Harmony\", supposedly due to its anti-war message (the hero refuses to carry a gun).  At the time CBS claimed their rejection was due to the use of hallucinogenic drugs in the plot.  While many prefer the anti-Vietnam scenario over the drug theory, several facts support CBS' version. First, they had already broadcast two episodes of entertainment series that were clearly against U.S.  involvement in southeast Asia (\"Route 66\", March 22, 1963; \"Twilight Zone\", Sept.  27, 1963). Secondly, the drugs in \"Harmony\" are quite different from those used in other \"Prisoner\" episodes. On most occasions, they have no more in common with recreational \"junk\" than truth serum as seen in more realistic spy dramas, while the plan here was to take our hero and \"fill him with hallucinotory drugs....dis-orient him\" according to the episode's dialogue. There is actually a third theory that is more likely than either of those.  \"Living In Harmony\" is not identified as a segment of \"The Prisoner\" until the end, unless you recognize star Patrick McGoohan, the parallels to \"Arrival\", and the typeface used in what credits there are (the episode title appears to be the series title).  When the program was first broadcast in the U.K., in some regions (it wasn't shown simultaneously across the country as in the U.S.) superimposed the words \"The Prisoner\" over the image at the beginning.  Star/Executive Producer/Creative driving force Patrick McGoohan reportedly didn't like this at all, but it would have forewarned him to contractually prohibit CBS from doing the same thing. According to this theory, CBS declined to air the episode rather than gamble on the intelligence of their audience.",

It was not officially submitted for UK cinema release until 1991 due to the film's graphic sexual nature and, although this print was fully uncut in terms of sexual footage, it featured an optical edit during the scene with the boy. Instead of removing the scene Ferman cropped off the bottom and far right of the screen, thus allowing the audience to realize the instability of Sada's character while removing the offending shot. The film first received a home video/DVD release in 2000 by Nouveaux and this print retained the optical edit, though the print itself was a shorter version and missed 6 minutes 15 secs of assorted dialogue and footage (the sexual footage remained uncut).

The following changes were made to the film for this release: - The \"In Association with Silver Screen Partners IV\" credit is replaced with \"The Special Edition Of--\" on the opening title sequence. The 2002 DVD omits this credit & the Walt Disney Pictures Presents credit stays on screen. - The animation in some of the scenes went back through the clean-up animation department a second time, to correct problems such as wavering lines and missing details, which, while not very noticeable during a traditional 35mm showing of the film, would have been discomforting on a much large IMAX screen. Small details, such as the blood in Beast's wound after his fight with the wolves, were also added. - The Beast's \"stutter\" (\"You wan-wanna stay in the tower?\"), a sound editing mistake, was corrected (\"You wanna stay in the tower?\"). - Six minutes of new footage was added between the songs \"Something There\" and \"Beauty and the Beast,\" most of which is made up of a new musical sequence, \"Human Again.\" This song was written by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken for the original version of the film, but cut for continuity purposes. After Alan Menken altered the song to make it work for the Broadway stage version of Beauty and the Beast, the song was worked back into the film. - During the \"Human Again\" song sequence, the household objects clean up the Beast's castle, which necessitated having the background artists go back and digitally re-paint the backgrounds for the castle scenes that followed so that the castle was clean. - The animation for Cogsworth's line to the Beast after Belle is freed (\"Yes-yes-yes, but...why?\") was completely re-done, as the directors never liked how the animation looked in the original version. - New sound effects are added to the shot where Belle and Phillippe leave the castle to find Maurice, which are supposed to suggest that the Beast trashes his room in anguish (and also so that the backgrounds from this point on would not have to be repainted). - The longer credits necessitated the addition of an additional passage of score music, the version of the 'Transformation' theme that was cut out of the original film, to the end of the film.",

This version has been distributed theatrically in some countries (such as France) and is available on video in Australia, the UK, the United States, and France. The French DVD includes both versions (via seamless branching), while the U.S. Criterion DVD features the cut footage as an extra. The PAL releases run 97 minutes. This shorter version makes the following changes: - An early scene in which Sada has sex with Ishida while playing a shamisen has been cut by about a minute and a half. In the original version, Sada seemingly goes unconscious and Ishida checks for her heartbeat. - A brief shot (12 seconds) of Ishida and Sada on a bridge has been added to the scene in which the couple goes out walking at night. - A later scene (in which the geishas assault one of their own with a dildo) is cut by 14 seconds to remove a shot of Ishida and Sada's faces in mid-copulation. - An entire two-minute scene is deleted about an hour into the film. This scene features Sada and Ishida having sex behind a thin screen, while Ishida speaks of the \"darkness\" he feels inside Sada. - The scene in which Sada first strangles Ishida is cut by just over one minute. In the short version, the scene ends when Ishida starts coughing and Sada releases his throat. In the original version, Ishida asks her to resume, which she does (only to stop when he begins coughing again). - The scene in which Ishida becomes drowsy while having sex with Sada is edited differently. The original version has slightly different dialogue and has an additional minute of footage where Ishida actually does fall asleep for a short time. - The scene in which Sada wakes up after her final night with Ishida is cut by one minute. The original version shows Sada lying on the floor and apparently panicking, walking around the room and opening doors for no obvious reason. The short version cuts straight from Sada waking up to the shot of her standing over Ishida's body.",

For example, in Little Pete's first scene, he is asked what his Dad would say about him hanging backstage with a rock band. In one version, Pete says \"Nothing. He's dead.\" In the other version, he instead says \"I never met my Dad. He's some kind of mystery\" (which serves as a better setup for information learned later) Also, Tony returns to the band's apartment after his release from the hospital, only to find they have moved out. In both versions, under 'People Are Strange,' we hear him on the phone with a friend, but the phone conversations begin completely differently. In one we never learn what happened to the band, only that they seemed to have moved out and left Tony behind, while in the other we learn that the band has gone on to big things, with a gold album. Both versions' phone calls end the same way, though, with Tony desperately asking his friend for money or drugs.",

At the bar with his friends, he saves a young woman from being hit by a man by fighting him. However, he gets thrown out by the doorman at the backlane. The two men then approach him to tell him about his twin Tommy's demise and the proposal of taking over. There's a close-up of a dead Tommy slowly consumed by the incinerator fire and it morphs to Jake at the spaceship as to point out them being twins. Due to that, the close-up (serves as the bookmark of the original opening and ending) of Jake opening his eyes on the ship has been removed. - Before taking off to Pandora, an extra line of the pilot has been added: \"Copy, Venture Star. Go for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4 niner.\" - The next two additions deal more about the abandoned school scene in the Special Edition. The first one happens when Grace considers a picture of Neytiri that Jake brought out, she starts to wallow in memories. about her twin Sylwanin. She reveals her dead, obviously killed by the mercenaries as well as Norm once had a relationship with her. - The second addition: After Grace insists Jake to have a meal, he sees a picture of Grace teaching a few Na'vi at school, two of them being a young Neytiri and her twin Sylwanin. She describes what happened on the day Sylwanin was killed and how the school was abandoned. - After the marines vacate the lab and prepare for retaliation, there is an extension by Grace which obviously reveals that the marines wanted and planned for a war with the Na'vi. The small sequence that happens in the theatrical version after that was removed. - There is also the alternative Family-friendly audio track, which substitutes profanity words with a more clean words. James Cameron said in an interview that the track was included when his young son complained on hearing that accidentally while playing the movie.",

ABBY: It's all Marty's. - After Marty suggests to the P.I. the \"incinerator\" as a means of destroying the evidence of his proposed murder, the P.I.'s line: \"Sweet Jesus, you're disgusting!\" is deleted. - A couple lines from the landlady showing Abby the studio apartment (mainly assuring her Abby won't be bothered at that location) before she starts yelling at her ex-brother-in-law, are deleted. - As Marty opens his safe to retrieve the bounty money (and swap the photo) his line: \"This is an illicit affair\" has been removed, although he can still be seen mouthing it. - When the P.I. shoots Marty, a couple shots are removed of Marty and the P.I. staring at each other after the gunshot. - When Ray and Abby are discussing \"what happened\", in her studio apartment, and Ray feels cold enough to rise from his seat, the shot of him steadying the walrus piggy-bank is removed and his dialog is heard off-screen to cover this change. - When Abby goes to see Maurice about her concerns, the scene cuts as soon as she enters. In the original version, the scene continues and she is seen inside his place and he pours a drink while assuring her that Marty is not dead, even though she is very worried that he is. Some of the dialog from inside the house is placed over the shot outside Maurice's door before Abby goes in, in the 1998 version. - A new page of credits is added at the end, covering the restoration.",
