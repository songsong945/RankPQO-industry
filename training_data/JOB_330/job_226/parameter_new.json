The more noticeable differences between The Director's Cut and The Final Cut include: - The overall film has been brightened considerably, revealing previously hidden details in many shots. Additionally, the digital enhancement reveals many heretofore obscured details, such as dirty dishes in Deckard's apartment and a freeway high above Pris as she approaches the Bradbury. - The opening credits have been completely redone, although in the exact same font as in the original film. The noticeable shimmer effect from the theatrical cut and the Director's Cut has been removed. - In the opening shot, the flames shooting up have been re-animated to look more synchronized with the associated light play on the smokestacks. - In the shots of the staring eye, you can briefly see the pupil react to the setting of 2019 L.A. - A couple of shots were trimmed (such as Deckard's intro reading the newspaper). - Additional smoke was added behind the cook when Gaff ('Edward James Olmos' (qv)) and a police officer are talking to Deckard while he is eating at the White Dragon. - All spinner wires have been removed and matte lines erased. - Bryant's ('M. Emmet Walsh' (qv)) line \"I've got four skin jobs walking the streets\" has been improved so it's not obviously an inserted recording. - Bryant says that \"2\" replicants were fried in the electrical field (as opposed to the theatrical release and Director's Cut, where he says only 1 was killed). - Bryant describes Leon's job during the incept tapes scene. - New Cityspeak and other chatter comes over on the police scanner in Gaff's spinner rides both to the police station and the Tyrell building. - The original shot of Roy ('Rutger Hauer' (qv)) in the VidPhone booth that had been recycled from the later confrontation with Tyrell ('Joe Turkel' (qv)) has been digitally altered so that it truly does look like Roy was in the booth. The thumb on his shoulder has also been digitally removed from the shot. - The hotel manager mutters \"Kowalski\" as he opens the door to Leon's ('Brion James (I)' (qv)) room for Deckard and Gaff. - The new Unicorn footage is longer and shows Deckard to be awake during the sequence. This is how Ridley Scott and editor 'Terry Rawlings' (qv) originally conceived of the scene. Deckard is shown staring into space, and there is a cut to the unicorn. The film then cuts back to Deckard and again cuts back to the unicorn, before returning to Deckard once more. The shot of the unicorn which appeared in the Director's Cut has also been recolored, and the sound mix has been completely redone. - The blue grid lines on the Esper machine have been reanimated, to make them look less smooth. - When Deckard finds Zhora lying down in the back room on the photo, the image is now that of 'Joanna Cassidy' (qv); previously, it was clearly someone else. - New footage of the LA streets before Animoid Row and Taffy Lewis's club, including the hockey-masked geisha dancers. - The serial number on the snake scale now matches the Animoid Row lady's dialog. - There is a shot of Deckard asking for directions to Taffy Lewis' from a uniformed policeman. - The lip flap between Deckard and Abdul Ben Hassan has been digitally corrected (using 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv)'s son, Ben, as a stand-in for his mouth movements). - In Zhora's death scene, you can tell it is her the entire time; previously it was obvious that her stunt double, 'Lee Pulford' (qv), was in the shot. Joanna Cassidy's head was digitally superimposed over Pulford's. - Deckard's cut after retiring Zhora was digitally removed (it wasn't supposed to be there until after the fight with Leon). - The marquee inconsistencies on the Million Dollar Theatre have been corrected. - During Roy's confrontation with Tyrell, he says, \"I want more life, father\", as opposed to \"I want more life, fucker\". - When Roy kills Tyrell, the footage is the same as that found in the International Cut, with the additional violence. Additionally, when Roy turns to Sebastian, he says \"I'm sorry, Sebastian. Come. Come\", as he walks towards him. - When Pris ('Daryl Hannah' (qv)) attacks Deckard, she reaches down and grabs him by the nostrils - When Deckard shoots Pris, he shoots 3 times instead of 2. - The two shadows (of Ridley Scott and 'Jordan Cronenweth' (qv)) seen on the wall during the chase sequence have been removed. - When Roy pushes the nail through his hand, there is a shot of the nail coming through the skin on the other side. - When Roy releases the dove, it now flies up into a background that matches 2019 L.A. - The music which plays over the end credits is a newly composed piece by 'Vangelis' (qv); a different version of the 'End Credits' theme as heard in all other cuts. - In the closing credits, 'David L. Snyder' (qv) is now listed as 'David L. Snyder', instead of 'David Snyder'. Additionally, 'Ben Astar' (qv) is now credited for playing the role of Abdul Ben Hassan.",

This cut was re-edited by Coppola and Walter Murch and features a new Technicolor dye prints with additional footage originally left out of thetheatrical release. The new version is 197 minutes long (53 minutes longer than the original version). The restored footage also includes the French plantation scenes with Aurore Clement and Christian Marquand, as well as scenes from the crew meeting the Playmates later on. - There are additional scenes when the crew is with Kilgore. During the napalm strike, he helps a wounded Vietnamese child. The napalm strike has ruined the favorable surfing conditions, so Lance and the others leave, much to Kilgore's dismay. Before they leave, Willard steals Kilgore's surfboard. Finally, just before Willard and Chef leave the boat to search for mangoes, a helicopter files by with Kilgore on loudspeaker, asking for his surfboard back. - In the Playmate scenes, Willard trades two drums of oil in exchange for spending two hours with the Bunnies. We see Chef with Miss May in a helicopter, and Lance with the Playmate of the Year in a ransacked house. Miss May was once a bird trainer at Busch Gardens and tries to talk about birds with Chef while he is busy trying to get her to re-enact her photo that he showed the crew. They end up kissing and Miss May gets excited because Chef kisses like a bird. The Playmate of the Year is talking to Lance about her troubles and insecurities about being a Playmate. Clean is seen trying to barge in on both men, and when he barges in on Lance, the Playmates open a chest (in which to hide) and discovers a dead Vietnamese. Lance comforts her. Chef finds out afterwards that Clean is a virgin and starts calling him names on the boat. Willard told Chief that the whole crew can spend time with the Bunnies, but Chief refuses. - At the plantation, Chef figures that they are French first and tells them in French that they are Americans and are friends. They bury Clean with his tape player there, and eat dinner with the French. The crew eats with the staff, and Willard eats with the family. Chef wants to speak to the chef but is informed he only speaks Vietnamese. Willard is lectured about France's colonial history in Indochine as well as their military blunders. There also is a scene with Willard and Roxanne, one of the French women, smoking opium. - At the Kurtz compound, Willard is imprisoned in an oven-like box. Kurtz appears, accompanied by a group of children. He reads to Willard from Time magazine articles about the Vietnam War.",

The scene picks up when the trio arrive in the vicinity of the jukebox. - Archie's high school flashback in which he asks Veronica to the prom, but she turns him down and informs him that she will be moving to France to go to college after graduation (takes place during their embrace as they walk through the park) - Reggie asking Archie to put in a good word for him with Ronnie in exchange for his trying to persuade Mr. Lodge not to evict Pop Tate, and Veronica's appearance out of the blue to kiss Archie--and changing Reggie's mind on his offer. - Robert and Pam exchanging names and shaking hands while the Archies sing \"Jingle Jangle\"",

A slightly longer opening sequence on the model's runway where a skinny audience members mumbles \"I both love it and I hate it\" before the first model blimps up. - 2. In the first Tender Loins sequence, there is new footage starting with a conversation with the bartender and Persephone about her new boyfriend, whose brother she is going to meet. The boyfriend shows up and his brother is revealed to be his Siamese twin with an inexplicable British accent and snooty, patrician attitude. The manager then panics because Erotica hasn't shown up for work. This segues into a sequence where Erotica as Stripperella (This is Stripperella's (And Erotica's)first appearance in the two-parter, NOT the reveal of Erotica as she starts her act in the Tender Loins, as it is in the single episode version) rescues a baby from the lion's pit at a zoo. Giving the baby to its mother she is thanked but griped at because she destroyed the baby's heirloom blanket. She then talks to the zoo-keeper about moving the lion's pit to a place farther from the kids play area. She continues to give a lecture about increasing the lion's pit size before looking at her watch and realizing that she is late for work. Then we see a sign on the front of the Tender Loins advertising \"The Best Cervix in Town!\" The original footage picks up here. This whole sequence lasts for about 2 1/2 minutes. - 3. When Stripperella enters Flinderman's en route to FUGG headquarters, new footage has her stop to admire a shoe sale before her navel ring beeper beeps again, causing her to continue running to the secret door to the headquarters. - 4. After another model blimps up at the Stiffy Woods concert video, new footage shows a scene in the Tender Loins as Persephone is talking with her boyfriend. It starts when Persephone eats a Marcino cherry, revealing that she is able to do origami with her tongue when she works the stem and makes a miniature model of the Eiffel Tower. Her boyfriend is impressed, but the snotty Brit wannabe Siamese bother asks her if she learned that trick at \"whore school\". The date continues until the boyfriend chokes. Persephone performs the Heimlich maneuver, explaining that lots of strippers choke when they grab dollar bills with their teeth. The Brit wannabe remarks sarcastically about the anecdote, resulting in an argument. This lasts a little over a minute. - 5. The scene introducing Dr. Cesearean is extended when he makes the joke about seeing Enorma \"in the obituary column!\" The original scene ended when he went back into his office, whereas the new one continues with him laughing maniacally in his office as the the camera pulls out and reveals his waiting room filled with shocked onlookers. This ends with a \"To Be Continued\". - 6. The \"Next on Stripperella\" segment shows footage from Part Two, including a scene showing the Siamese twins fighting each other. - PART ONE runs for about 22 minutes without commercial.",

Several lines of dialogue were changed, using many alternative and unused shots. The movie was edited down to 94 minutes, removing many major scenes, placing more emphasis on Tuttle's character and Sam's relationship with Jill. - The opening Central Services advertisement for ducts stops just before the shop window explodes. It then cuts straight to the restaurant explosion scene, with none of the dialogue leading up to it, beginning only with Shirley offering Sam the salt and the following explosion. The title \"Brazil\" then appears and the scene ends. - During the prologue in which the fly falls in the typewriter, the scene cuts back and forth to text on a computer screen explaining the plot premise, including a voice over reading it aloud. - All the fantasy sequences are missing, except the scene of Sam flying through clouds - which is shortened and has a glowing effect applied to indicate it is a dream. - Extended dialogue in the scenes where Sam meets Jack at Information Retrieval, before he is distracted by Jill on the TV screens. The screens change to show Jill as she appears in Sam's dreams. - It is never stated that Mr Buttle is dead, only asked by his wife. - When Sam goes to visit Mrs Buttle at Shangri-La Towers, instead of morosely screaming \"What have you done with his body?\" she begins hitting Sam with paper with the line \"Lousy bastard\" dubbed over. - Lots of the swearing was dubbed over with tamer dialogue, often very badly. Several of Sam's swears are replaced with \"Judas!\". - Alternative dialogue in the scene in Jack's office. In this version, Sam puts on the suit earlier before having a conversation with Jack about Tuttle, and Jack's daughter is never shown on screen. - A cut of Casablanca featuring the line \"Here's lookin' at you, kid.\" Right after Sam leaves Kurtzmann's office. - Extended dialogue between Jill and Sam in the truck. - You don't see the guard on fire when the Police vehicle crashes after the truck chase. - When armed guards manhandle Jill after the apartment store explosion, Sam simply picks up a plastic arm from a shop dummy and prepares to fight. The giant samurai warrior is not seen at all in this version. - Extended, more romantic dialogue between Sam and Jill after Tuttle switches the pipes at Sam's flat. Jill explains to Sam that she \"looked him up\" to find out where he lived. - After Sam is arrested, it cuts straight to the torture chamber scene, as in the US theatrical cut. However, Jack's mask is never explicitly shown and a different, close-up shot is used when Jack confronts Sam in the chair. - After the ministry building is blown up, a 'deleted' form ordering the arrest of Harry Tuttle is shown on screen. The following scene of Tuttle being attacked by paper is then taken out of context, implying the Ministry is eliminating him using supernatural powers (it is not revealed to be a dream in this version). - After Tuttle's disappearance, it cuts immediately to Sam and Jill driving in the truck, with no explanation for how they escaped arrest. There is then a sequence set in the countryside showing Jill on a farm. Sam is shown asleep in bed (re-using a shot from earlier the film). The camera zooms to show a picture on the wall of a winged Sam, before cutting to a dream shot of Sam carrying Jill and flying up into the clouds. - The credits are displayed on a background of clouds. However, the image of Sam sitting in the torture chair is still visible superimposed over it, as seen in the US theatrical cut.",

Most of the scenes involving the sultry seductress and spy Farrah have been completely removed, which makes her role in this version of the story almost inexplicable. Other scenes have been severely truncated or re-shot: There is a scene with Feyd Harkonnen in a bath being pampered by three women. In this version the women are fully clothed. When Princess Corrino seduces Feyd Harkonnen for information, the scene fades out abruptly, implying that the Princess gave herself to Feyd for the information. In uncut version, after extracting the information, the Princess presents a topless Farrah as a gift to Feyd, and during the 'love scene' that ensues, the Princess slips away. Considering that the Princess' virginity is the prize offered to both the male heirs of the Atreides and Harkonnen clans, this clumsy cut significantly changes the story. There is a scene where the Fremen remove their desert camouflage and uniforms, revealing their nakedness to Paul Atreides. It is a symbolic scene, for Paul sees that under their uniforms, the Fremen are people, just like he and his mother. The American TV version is so heavily cut that Paul seems to be just looking blankly into space.",

This changes the feel of the entire scene--as though they were suggesting that Soundwave is attempting to discover the secrets of transforming (while he himself is transformed, mind you). - They dubbed in a new swoosh sound as Soundwave lunges for Spike. - In the scene change from Soundwave retreating to Prime spotting him, the animation takes on a strange greenish hue while it's inside the computer window.  I think the computer animators forgot to adjust their tint settings; once the window goes away, the colors of the scene are restored. - When Prime is dangling on the ledge inside the power plant and Megatron asks if he has any last words, when Prime says, \"None you'd wanna hear, Megatron!\" they used an inset of Prime's head.  The problem is, they took it from a later scene when he's back outside, so it's got a blue sky background. - They also added a fizzling sound when Megatron steps on Prime's hand. - The \"green screen\" effect happens again when Prime grabs Jazz's grappling cord. At the end, during the preview for part 3, they sampled the sound effect of Hound creating the holographic rocket base and reused it for the scene of Prime being blasted out of the sky by the Decepticon space cruiser. - The voice credits are from \"More Than Meets the Eye\" this time, but there is no mention of 'Welker, Frank' (qv).",

The attendant says \"Swedish Made Enlarger\" instead, and he has not been overdubbed. - In the Group Therapy scene, after Dr. Evil talks about having his testicles shaved, he goes on to talk about wanting to be an actor - dialogue not in the original release. - An alternate take of a scene in Dr. Evil's lair. In the theatrical version, Scott describes his planned evening as \"a titty movie on Skinemax.\" On TBS, he says \"a porno movie on cable.\" Later, Dr. Evil asks Scott if he wants to see what Daddy does for a living. Scott's response is \"Blow me,\" which he follows up with \"Show me\" when Dr. Evil asks him to repeat that. In the TBS version, Scott says \"Bite me,\" which he follows up with \"Might be fun.\" - The line \"I never forget a pussy ... cat\" has been redubbed \"I never forget a kitty ... cat\", which ruins the joke. - Two versions of the \"lifeboat\" alternate ending were broadcast on TBS. In one, Basil arrives hanging from a helicopter. He gives Vanessa her full accreditation as a field agent, and gives Austin the card of a dental specialist. In the second ending, after Austin and Vanessa kiss we are treated to a roll-call of the major characters and what happened to them, as the \"Great Escape March\" plays in the background.",

Lambert tells Ripley, Parker and Brett how the face hugger got on Kane. - Ripley radios down to Parker and Brett to see how they're progressing on the repairs, Parker and Ripley exchange tense words over the radio. - After the face hugger's acid eats through a few floors, the crew returns to the med lab to check up on Kane's condition.  Ripley sees an X-Ray of Kane's chest and asks Ash, \"What is that dark stain on Kane's lung?\"  The rest of the crew starts asking if Kane's going to live, Dallas tells everyone to go back to work. - After Kane's death, the crew gathers around at the meal table to discuss what they're going to do with the escaped alien.  Brett announces the cattle-prod idea and suggests \"catching\" the alien in a net. - Longer version of Brett's death.  This scene had Brett frozen with fear as the alien grabs his head, he yells \"Parker!\" and then blood poors from beneath his cap.  The alien lifts him up into the landing gear and Ripley and Parker come rushing in.  Parker stands where Brett once was and looks up; blood drips on his shirt and then Brett's cattle prod falls to Parker's feet. - Part of a scene that involves Parker, Ripley and Lambert trying to flush the alien out of the air lock.  As they are about to succeed, an alarm is triggered and the alien rushes out of the airlock (getting its tail caught in the closing door, and spilling acid that causes a hull breach).  Parker falls unconciously to the floor, Ripley does the same and Lambert and Ash come to their rescue.  Ripley vocalizes her suspicions about Ash by accusing him of setting the alarm off. - After Dallas's disappearance, Ripley (being suspicious of Ash) asks Lambert if she's ever slept with him. - The build-up to Lambert's death is much longer.

        "The differences as shown in the elongated TV version [indicated from a 1999 November showing on the Sci-Fi channel] are: - 1. Darkman (Arnold Vosloo) is introduced in the film immediately before the car chase; watching it from above. He then slides down a rope in front of a neon-lit sign. In a series of crosscutting, the car chase ensues as Darkman runs on rooftops. In the DVD/VHS version, Darkman is not introduced until after the car chase ends when the character Steve is shot; followed by a woman's scream. The shot of Darkman swinging down is never featured. The crosscutting of Darkman running only occurs as a gunman flees from the car wrecks. The TV version also features a shot of the policemen apprehending the immobilized gunman after Darkman's remark: \"Thanks for the donation.\" This single shot is absent from the DVD/VHS. - 2. After the scene where Peyton Westlake and Dr. David Brinkman (Jesse Collins) agree to be partners, Brinkman is seen waving off to a jetting Westlake replying solemnly, \"Partners...\" Directly afterward, a wide establishing tracking shot of Westlake's lab is featured. It then cuts to a medium shot of Westlake silently switching on a remote control. A radio is heard during these two shots reporting the weather. In the DVD/VHS version, none of this included. As Westlake jets out of Brinkman's lab, it cuts directly to a shot of Westlake's remote camera running across the floor with Westlake already at the controls. - 3. Westlake, once again in his lab, becomes enraged after reminiscing about what Dr. David Brinkman said to him before his murder. He screams savagely knocking objects off his desk, and then proceeds to run around his lab destroying additional objects. He is then interrupted by the TV's broadcast stating the name, \"Robert Durant...\" which features the character Jill Randall (Kim Delaney) and her live report. This then gives the motivation for Westlake to meet her. In the DVD/VHS version, this bit where he is interrupted by the TV is missing. - 4. When Westlake is confronted by Jill at the post office, the scene ends with a shot of her walking out the door and him in a close up holding up his scarred hands and then putting them to his face. This shot is missing in the DVD/VHS version. - 5. Before the scene where the character Eddie (David Ferry) is knocked out in the bathroom, a medium shot on a street corner shows Eddie stopping to look at his watch, and then him proceeding across the street with a silver briefcase. The shot eventually tilts up to reveal a large office building. In the DVD/VHS version, an exterior shot at the same street corner features the building, but no Eddie at all. It is a different shot because the traffic is not the same. - 6. When Darkman salutes Jill's photo seen on a TV in a store window, a shot shows him walk off with his cart further down to darker parts of the street as Randy Miller's musical score intensifies. The narration starts as the shot dissolves to a silhouette of Darkman looking out towards the city. In the DVD/VHS version, the narration starts at the shot of Darkman saluting, which then dissolves directly to the silhouette. - NOTE: Ordinarily, the intensely violent moments of the film are also removed to fit TV standards [depending on what that particular network allows].",

In the opening scene where Sweet (Matthias Hues) attacks a group of thugs the UK version is the most complete. In the UK version when Hues lifts up and head-butts a thug the camera pans down the thugs face revealing blood pouring from his mouth. In the US DVD the scene cuts away before the camera reaches his mouth. The DVD is also missing several punches to the next thugs ribs. The thug lying on the bed who gets his arm broken is cut identically in both versions. The scene where Dillon (Don Wilson) enters the dead prostitutes room is cut in the UK version. In the DVD we see a close up shot of the woman lying on the bed which is cut from the UK tape. The scene where the thugs attack Shanna's house is cut on the DVD. The knife wielding thug that attacks Dillon get his arm broken in the UK tape before he is thrown through the table. On the DVD the arm break is missing. The scene where Sweet attacks the two men on the street has been cut for the UK version. We should see Sweet lift up the first thug and head-butt him but this is missing from the UK tape (but surprisingly a photo of that exact scene is printed on the back of the tape). The scene where Sweet kills Dillons partner is cut on both versions. Close up punches to the face have been cut from the UK version. Sweet breaking the mans neck has been cut differently on both versions.

The DVD is also missing the neck break but all of the 'Time to die' dialogue is also missing. The final martial arts scene in Dillon's apartment has been cut differently in both versions. All scenes showing Nunchaku sticks have been cut from the UK version. Various snippets of martial arts have been cut from both versions.

        "The R2 Special Edition (available on the Alien Quadrology Boxset as well as separately) contains 7 extra minutes of altered and/or extended scenes. As a result, there is a little more character development, but the music has also been re-edited (a bit poorly) in some scenes. Here follows a short description: - The main titles (the distorted shots of the 7 early Ripley clones in the theatrical cut) have been replaced by an alternate opening, which starts with a close-up of a growling alien mouth. As the camera pulls back, it is revealed to be the beak of a fly, that is subsequently squashed by a thumb of a soldier. The soldier uses a straw to blow the fly's blood against a window, which shows that he is actually sitting in a nacell of the Auriga spaceship. The rest of the shot shows the Auriga slowly flying away from camera. - Directly after the chestburster has been surgically removed from Ripley 8, she wakes up from her narcosis, grips the surgeon's arm and breaks it. - In the scene where Ripley is shown drawings of a glove and fruit, directly after Genral Perez, Wren and Gediman leave, the doctor shows Ripley a drawing of a young, blond girl, which seems to trigger an emotional memory in her. - During the meal scene, Ripley repeats Gediman's 'Fiori 16', and he asks her what she remembers. Dr. Wren can also tells some more about the Weyland-Yutani company (\"bought up by Wall-Mart\") - The 'Betty introduction scene has been completely re-edited and extended. The scene now starts with the Betty flying towards the Auriga, Elgyn giving the clearance code over the radio (E-A-T-M-E), but now he flirts some more with Hillard, and warns Call and Vriess over the intercom to get ready. Next, Call and Vriess are shown working on the cargo, followed by some extended dialogue in which Vriess tells Call an obscene joke. This is followed by the scene in which Christie gets his hidden weapons (which came first in the original cut). Next is Johner's 'target practice', Vriess then throws a tool to his head, Call calls him names, but Johner simply replies by asking for his knife. When Vriess comments on his alcoholism, Johner demans his knife back, Call breaks it, Johner threatens her, and there is an extra line from Vriess that he and Cal deserve better company. - During the deal between Elgyn and Perez, Elgyn has some more 'flattering' remarks about Call, thinking Vriess has an eye on her. After Elgyn asks Perez for three days bed and board, Perez agrees under a few conditions (no tresspassing in restricted areas, no trouble, no fighting). - After Purvis shouts \"What's in-f###ing-side me?!?\", Wren answers: \"A parasite! A foreign element!\" After Call says that Purvis can be frozen and operated later, she has another run-in with Johner, followed by Christie agreeing that Purvis comes, but saying he will shoot him if he starts acting funny. - Just before everyone takes a dive through the flooded kitchen, Christie and DiStephano have a short conversation on Christie's weapons ('the disposable kind'), and Call reminds everyone to take a deep breath. - In the chapel, just after Purvis' fake chestburst, there is an extended line from Call, stating she recalibrated ground level, sending the ship into an uninhabited quadrant of Earth, before she mentions time of impact. After Ripley asks if she's the new a##hole model, she replies she couldn't let humanity annihilate itself. Ripley comments that she once tried to save people as well; she remembers a girl that had bad dreams, but she died despite her help, and now she can't even remember her name. After DiStephano enters to take them with him, Ripley asks Call if she dreams, which Call does thanks to neural processors; Ripley says she dreams about the aliens every night, and that she used to be afraid, but not anymore, since it is always worse when she wakes up. - After Johner kissed Vriess for getting them safely through Earth's atmosphere, there is an alternate ending with the Betty landing on Earth. Call warns Ripley for the military that will come looking for her soon. She says someone can get pretty lost on Earth, and asks Ripley what to do. Ripley replies that she doesn't know, since she is a stranger there herself. The camera then goes up, to reveal a post-apocalyptical Paris.",

He thinks that everyone will be carrying a gun so he makes believe he's holding a gun with his hands, and mimics Eastwood-like moves and even says to a man, \"Are you feeling lucky punk?\" - Bean reprising the 'head in the lap' gag in which he is wearing a blindfold to help him sleep while on the plane to America. He starts to fall down in his seat and then manages to have his head fall into the crotch of the passenger sitting next to him. The passenger yells for a stewardess to switch him to a different seat and Bean tries to make sense of the situation by screaming \"I'M BLIND!\" since he is still wearing the blindfold. - The Langley family falls asleep waiting for Bean at the airport. What they don't know is that Bean actually HAS arrived at their house by way of a Taxi. He gets inside and plays around with a remote control for what he thinks is the TV but is actually the garage door opener. Bean then picks up a SONY Walkman for the first time and then starts to listen to music and do an impromptu dance in his pajamas all over the house. - The Langley's arriving home and Bean using their bathroom. Bean and David continue a set of 'near misses' as one goes outside the room as another comes in. Bean, searching for his toothpaste, comes across what he thinks is David's toothpaste but is actually a tube of medicinal toe cream. Bean puts it on his toothbrush, brushes and after a bit smiles and says \"Mmmm! Nice!\" - A lot more of Bean's destroying of Whistler's mother (A lot of the pictures for this scene can be found in the books for the film) is shown. Bean going into the Grierson Gallery men's room and attempting to wash off the ink by using a toilet brush. Hearing others who want to use the facilities, Bean places the painting outside a window and onto the building's ledge. He then walks out on the ledge and tries to grab it while trying not to disrupt the security meeting with David, Elmer, George, Bernice, and Walter. - Bean tries to calm David's panic over the destroyed painting by coming up with the idea of placing a tiny piece of paper saying \"DO NOT COME IN\" on the doors. David's reaction to this is \"EXCELLENT! It's perfect! Problem is solved! Apart from one tiny drawback, that someone will eventually walk through that door, they'll see the painting and say, \"Oh look, someone has completely destroyed 'Whistler's Mother'. Let's Kill Them!!!\" leaving Bean at a loss for words. - A 'breakfast' scene at the Langley's shows Bean making scrambled eggs and toast for David and Andrew while David tries to think of what to say at the unveiling. \"I get to go in and tell everyone that 'Whistler's Mother' now looks like Pinocchio's Father!\" - An extended scene of Burt Reynolds' character General Newton meeting the staff of the Grierson Gallery including Bean.",

In both versions, under 'People Are Strange,' we hear him on the phone with a friend, but the phone conversations begin completely differently. In one we never learn what happened to the band, only that they seemed to have moved out and left Tony behind, while in the other we learn that the band has gone on to big things, with a gold album.

And the second version, added in at the behest of Peter Sellers who was not happy with its inclusion, features the credits rolling over static, accompanied by the film's theme and sound clips from various television programs, and closed by a clip from a Gatorade commercial from the era. Most prints on television and home video use the first version of the credits. Version #2 was used on the general theatrical release, and in the 1980 MGM/CBS Home Video release of the film. Version #1 was reinstated when the film was reissued on video by CBS/FOX Video in 1983.",
