Jerry then says that Bud is probably not home and they move on to find him. It then cuts to Bud meditating on the beach. In the unrated version, it just moves on to Bud's meditation. - An additional scene of conversation between Jerry, Dave and Bud. Dave and Jerry notice the surfboards on Bud's patio and he says that he still surfs every now and then but is more into \"cosmic surfing.\" - A scene where Xena asks Dave what Bud is doing. Dave replies that Bud is meditating, and briefly explains what that is. Dave then introduces the Beach Babes to Uncle Bud. Bud asks if the Beach Babes want to stay for dinner, to which Dave says he's sure they would love it. Xena consider going back to the T-Bird ship, until Luna declares that it is the perfect opportunity for a \"social studies\" project. - A scene showing Bud going into his house to mix up a remedy for Jerry's sunburn. In the unrated version, this scene is missing entirely and just cuts to Bud applying the remedy to Jerry's sunburn. - A scene where Bud unsuccessfully tries to reason with Sally to give him more time to fix up his home. Sally tells Bud that she is angry with him for not marrying him. Sally then calls Hassler to talk about Bud's visit and how he refuses to change his place. Hassler gives Sally some suggestions, which do not fare well with Sally. After the call, we see a woman walk up to Hassler and Hassler asks \"So where were we?\". The woman replies with they were going to get the agrees. Hassler replies with \"Oh, yeah.\" - A scene with Bud's house being condemned. The city official (Played by Lenny Rose, who would later go on to play James T. Renford II in the sequel), tells Bud that he'll work something out for Bud to stay at his place until Monday to get the house fixed. Bud tells the Beach Babes along with Dave, Jerry and Ziggy that he has to run an errand and will be back. Also, the director has an uncredited cameo as a city worker.

Esteban's run in the city to the tavern is shorter, but an additional overhead shot is shown. The scene in which Pedro and Sancho are telling the story about the city of gold is shortened (they don't talk about how the patrons of the bar should invest in their adventure.) There is an additional scene of Esteban looking shocked when the official says \"find him and you'll receive a whole piece of gold.\" There is a scene difference in when Mendoza is waiting for Esteban at the dock, he waits longer, but Esteban's run to meet him is shorter. The ending of Episode 1 is omitted in that Esteban discovers Zia only. The scene in which Mendoza smiles at the discovery that Esteban makes of Zia, and the both looking to see the clouds turn into the winged serpent forshadowing things to come is not there. - Episode 2: The daydreaming scene in which the golden butterflies turns into the city of gold is omitted, as well as the daydreaming scene in which Esteban is seasick and floating above the mayan ruins. - Episode 3: The daydreaming scene of the seamonster eating the ship is omitted. - Episode 4: Has the longest runtime of all the episodes of the series contains many additions, cuts, and an alternate ending. Additions include Extended footage of Mendoza rescuing the children with Esteban grabbing onto him through the bars so he doesn't get sucked out, followed by Dialogue of Gomez on the deck of the ship saying something about Gaspard. Gomez then slides down the deck of the ship and gets into the boat. There is a scene added in which Pedro and Sancho wake up in each others arms on the deck of the Esperanza when Esteban calls to Mendoza about the St. Elmos fire. There is also an extended scene after the shark attack where Pedro and Sancho say something off camera, and goes into an on camera dialogue with Esteban and Zia's dialogue about Esteban's father. - Omitted scene: There is a small scene of the raft sitting still in the sunlight. - Alternate Ending: Once the Island is discovered our heroes merely paddle their way toward the island, seeing shots of the lizards, and shots of the island. The Episode ends right here, and the entire footage in the English/French versions of Mendoza swimming from the sharks is gone. - Some of the scenes from Episode 4 alternate ending and the rescue can be seen in the English/French version Previous and To Follow segments - Episode 5: This starts where the English/French Episode 4 ends at the raft on the island. There is a scene omission of Zia lifting her dress to sit down. This Episode ends right where Tao points the crossbow at Esteban. - Episode 6: Starts in the tree house right where Episode 5 left off, and has a small scene of Mendoza Pedro and Sancho arriving on the raft. From this point forward all Episodes are in Synch with the English/French versions, with very few differences. - Episode 9: Starts with an additional second of footage zoomed in on the Solaris's sail - Episode 27: Has a second of footage containing a lightning bolt omitted at the start of the Episode - Episode 29: In the Japanese version when Esteban Tao and Zia are struck by the Olmec ray, Esteban spins around much slower and the background isn't changed as much. - Closing Credits: There is an additional bit of animation used of the sun and then transitioning to Esteban's face - None of the previous, to follows, or live action documentaries are on the Japanese DVD's",

This version has been distributed theatrically in some countries (such as France) and is available on video in Australia, the UK, the United States, and France. The French DVD includes both versions (via seamless branching), while the U.S. Criterion DVD features the cut footage as an extra. The PAL releases run 97 minutes. This shorter version makes the following changes: - An early scene in which Sada has sex with Ishida while playing a shamisen has been cut by about a minute and a half. In the original version, Sada seemingly goes unconscious and Ishida checks for her heartbeat. - A brief shot (12 seconds) of Ishida and Sada on a bridge has been added to the scene in which the couple goes out walking at night. - A later scene (in which the geishas assault one of their own with a dildo) is cut by 14 seconds to remove a shot of Ishida and Sada's faces in mid-copulation. - An entire two-minute scene is deleted about an hour into the film. This scene features Sada and Ishida having sex behind a thin screen, while Ishida speaks of the \"darkness\" he feels inside Sada. - The scene in which Sada first strangles Ishida is cut by just over one minute. In the short version, the scene ends when Ishida starts coughing and Sada releases his throat. In the original version, Ishida asks her to resume, which she does (only to stop when he begins coughing again). - The scene in which Ishida becomes drowsy while having sex with Sada is edited differently. The original version has slightly different dialogue and has an additional minute of footage where Ishida actually does fall asleep for a short time. - The scene in which Sada wakes up after her final night with Ishida is cut by one minute. The original version shows Sada lying on the floor and apparently panicking, walking around the room and opening doors for no obvious reason. The short version cuts straight from Sada waking up to the shot of her standing over Ishida's body.",

Altered in the sense that everything except the running storyline of the episode was cut, resulting in the running time dropping from one hour to 12 to 17 minutes.  To fill the running time, elements from the 1981-1982 \"Wake up\" version (none of which were made into PBS versions), and other late episodes, such as Bill Cosby's \"Picture Pages\" segments, and scenes with Kevin Clash's troupe of puppets, making each episode around 28 minutes on PBS.  These versions also featured a new theme song (the much more upbeat \"Here Comes Captain Kangaroo!\" theme replaced the CBS \"Good Morning, Captain\" opening) and opening credit segment,  showing clips from the series rather than the previous, partly animated opening. One of the many hour-long videos released in 1984-1986 (when the show was between homes) was \"Captain Kangaroo and His Friends\".

The Allumination version was created by cutting 05:51 out of the Bonneville feature; the longest cut (02:42) begins in the \"Twinkie\" scene when Jess promises May Belle that he will get even with Janice Avery for eating May Belle's Twinkie, continuing through Leslie and Jess forging a letter to Janice from Willard Hughes, through Jess putting the letter in Janice's desk, through Jess seeing puppies being given away for free, through Leslie telling Jess that Janice is in the bathroom crying, and stopping just before Leslie tells Jess why Janice is crying. The shortest of the 13 cuts is 4 seconds. Noticeable cuts include: (after May Belle tells Jess she followed him and Leslie) Jess threatening May Belle (\"I catch you following me and your life ain't worth nothin'.\" and \"I'll tell Billie Jean Edwards you still wet your bed.\"); after Jess enters Miss Edmunds' red sports car and Miss Edmunds says \"I'm so glad your mom let you come today\", Jess' response, \"Oh! I forgot to call ... oh, never mind\"; Jess and Miss Edmunds looking at abstract paintings in the art museum; (while Jess is at the museum with Miss Edmunds) Bill telling Leslie they could go to town for dinner and a show in the evening; (after Mr. Aarons catches Jess in his arms) the exchange [Jess] \"I hate her. I hate her. I wish I'd never seen her in my whole life.\" [Mr. Aarons] It's not your fault. [Jess] \"It's all my fault. I was supposed to meet her and I didn't. It wouldn't have happened, Leslie would still be ... [Mr. Aarons] \"Hey, Jess -- you can't blame yourself. It's not your fault. [Jess] But I hurt so bad inside, Daddy.\" [Mr. Aarons] \"I know -- I hurt too.\"; (later) [Jess] \"I didn't mean that about hating her.\" [Mr. Aarons] \"I know you didn't, Son.\"; and (after May Belle says \"Boys ain't supposed to cry, are they Mommy?\") [Mrs. Aarons] \"Shut up, both of you, and get out now. [to Jess] Don't you pay any attention to them, just finish eating.\"",

After getting on the train the Mertzs tell the Ricardos that they're heading towards the dining car for something to eat. After they leave the Ricardos, there is a montage of scenes showing the Mertzs going into the dining car and being escorted to a table on the second floor of the car where the dome viewing area is. All subsequent airings of this episode omit the scene but a rare 16MM print of the episode, with the scene intact, restored it for the season five DVD release of the show in 2005. The scene was cut from television airings because it was out of sequence with the story. If you look closely at the domed windows of the dining car, you can clearly see the reflections of lights passing over them, simulating a train that is moving at a pretty good speed. However, this scene was placed in the show at a time when the train that the Ricardos and the Mertzes were on had not even left Union Station in Los Angeles. After the Mertzes are seen in the domed dining car of the moving train, the station master announces the departure of their train from the station along with a shot of the train pulling away from the platform in a later scene. Union Pacific Railroad provided Desilu Productions with assistance for several scenes in this episode.",

Audrey tells Joey that at least she gets to enjoy her baggage on a beautiful creek. Dawson shows Audrey around Capeside. She says that living in L.A. people only think that towns like Capeside exists in the movies, Dawson says that living in a town like Capeside people think L.A. exists only in dreams.

The scene ends with Audrey asking \"God, it sounds so pathetic, doesn't it?\" and Dawson replies with \"See that fountain?\" (an in-joke to \"Creek\" fans who know that Pacey suffered a humiliating experience at that exact same fountain when he found out that a popular girl agreed to go out with him only because she thought he was dying). - Linking to episode",

On the other hand, the MSX version is more of an exploration game, requiring player to find keys to clear stages and having to purchase their power-ups from merchants. The level designs and some of the enemies are different as well. The MSX version uses the same sprites as the Famicom version (with more colors), but with different backgrounds. In Europe, the MSX version was released as \"Vampire Killer\" and most people often erronously believed that it was made first due to the later copyright date in the localized NES version (Castlevania).",

In the original version, Sada seemingly goes unconscious and Ishida checks for her heartbeat. - A brief shot (12 seconds) of Ishida and Sada on a bridge has been added to the scene in which the couple goes out walking at night. - A later scene (in which the geishas assault one of their own with a dildo) is cut by 14 seconds to remove a shot of Ishida and Sada's faces in mid-copulation. - An entire two-minute scene is deleted about an hour into the film. This scene features Sada and Ishida having sex behind a thin screen, while Ishida speaks of the \"darkness\" he feels inside Sada. - The scene in which Sada first strangles Ishida is cut by just over one minute. In the short version, the scene ends when Ishida starts coughing and Sada releases his throat. In the original version, Ishida asks her to resume, which she does (only to stop when he begins coughing again). - The scene in which Ishida becomes drowsy while having sex with Sada is edited differently. The original version has slightly different dialogue and has an additional minute of footage where Ishida actually does fall asleep for a short time. - The scene in which Sada wakes up after her final night with Ishida is cut by one minute.

        "-***Spoiler Alert - Alternate Ending*** The Director's Cut contains a more tragic ending. Mike Enslin sets fire to 1408 but is not rescued by the fire department. Instead, the last we see of him is when he's lying on his back in the burning room and we hear the words of his daughter \"everybody dies\". The camera zooms in on the numbers on the outside door, just as they melt from the heat. The next scene is at Mike's funeral where his coffin is lowered into the ground right next to his daughter's; just as the visions 1408 prophesied. Lily is there, being consoled by Mike's agent. As the procession ends, Lily walks to her car and is met by Gerald Olin who is carrying a box. Gerald introduces himself and gives his condolences. He says the box contains some of Mike's belongings still left in the room. He offers it to Lily while also trying to explain, with a sense of hope, that Mike's death of was not in vain and that because of his actions no one else will *ever be able to stay in room 1408. Lily, in too much grief to listen, cuts him off and refuses to accept the box. Gerald returns to his car and opens the box, which contains the nightgown that was sent through the fax machine as well and the burned tape recorder. Gerald plays it and hears the same dialog between Mike and his daughter heard at the end of the theatrical release. As he listens, he sees a young girl in his rear-view mirror waving in his direction. He turns around to look at her and catches a brief vision of Mike Enslin in his back seat, hideously burned. Gerald jumps but the vision quickly disappears. He looks back at the girl who has found her dad that was looking for her. Gerald catches his breath, starting his car and driving off. The final scene goes back to room 1408. We see a specter Mike Enslin staring out the window. The last shot is of him finishing his cigarette and walking towards the door just as he vanishes.",

The beginning is different - shorter - and introduces Harold Abrahams while playing cricket with his colleagues. The scene in the train station, where Monty meets Harold is absent, as well as the loading of the baggage in the taxi they share. We simply see Monty writing a letter to his parents, mentioning that \"Harold is as intense as ever\" (cut to the cricket scene, maybe 30 seconds long), and then continues with \"I remember our first day... we shared a taxi together\" (cut to the two students unloading their stuff from the car). This alternate version also have slightly different end credits, and does not mention Harold marrying Sybil. The differences are minor (the U.S. version provides a more shocking memento of WWI, when it shows crippled baggage handlers in the station); one of the reasons the cricket scene was dropped in favour  of the station one was due to the distributor's worry that the American  market would not understand it.",

        "SPOILER: The original British Thorn EMI VHS release, when compared to the 2005 Mosaic DVD appears to have many scenes that were not merely edited for censorship but were different takes used in a 'tamer' version. Most obvious is the scene where Patsy introduces Sally to the gang as a potential prostitute. In the original Thorn EMI release she remains fully clothed throughout and when Fallon is asked if he wants to 'check out this piece of merchandise' him and Sally simply walk off screen. In the 2005 DVD Sally undresses in front of the gang at Patsy's insistence and is naked when Fallon approaches her. Another scene that was a different take is when Norris kills Fallon in the woodwork lab. In the Thorn EMI release he simply pushes Fallon back over the saw blade killing him almost instantly. In the 2005 DVD he cuts off Fallon's right arm first, Fallon then staggers upright and THEN Norris pushes him back on the blade. Other scenes cut completely and now reinstated are: - The entire fight with Joo Joo's gang. - The rape scene - Barnyard, Patsy and Drugstore finding Fallon's body - Drugstore's death scene (more close ups of his body) - Norris hitting Barnyard more times on the head with the pipe. - Stegman cutting Diane's breasts before fighting Norris. Also the 2005 DVD has written prologue and epilogue. The prologue states the amount of attacks on staff in US High Schools and states that 'no high school is as bad as Lincoln High....yet'. The epilogue states that 'Andy Norris was never prosecuted as the police couldn't find anyone who actually saw it.",

(0:21) - After Cheng and Duan are accosted by rioting students, after the photo session. They are being carted through the streets on handcarts. Na Kun is following, on foot. They discuss first the student revolutionaries, and then the incident at Old Man Zhang's house, which is now a coffin shop. Dieyi mentions that he was there the day before; Na conjectures that he was probably looking for the sword. (0:51) - After Cheng and Duan meet Yuan Shiqing for the first time, and Cheng is presented with jewelry. Brief dialogue as Yuan and then Duan leave the room.

Cheng steps out of his home, smoking and looking quite listless. He chokes as a car passes. Then we see Juxian showing a group of Duan's friends to the exit of their home, recovering money that her husband has lent them. Juxian complains that Duan doesn't have a real job; Duan responds that all he can do is sing, and Juxian has forbidden that. Juxian mentions that Duan and Cheng's old teacher wants to see them; Duan says that he is too ashamed to face him. (2:02) - After Juxian visits Cheng in his cell, just before trial. Beginning of the trial dialogue cut, where Peking Opera is described as \"pornographic music\", and the formal charges of collusion with the Japanese Officer, Aoki, are described.

(1:01) - After the communists march into Beijing, Cheng and Duan are performing \"Farewell\" to an audience of communist troops. The troops do not respond, and then break into a patriotic song afterwards. Xiao Si seems to take to their philosophy. This scene cuts into what seems to be one large crowd scene in the U.S. release -- everything depicting Xiao Si (the foundling) skipping through the streets of Beijing comes after this scene. (1:52) - After Juxian's suicide, and before we cut to the present day, we get a short scene where the traitorous Xiao Si seems to get his due. He is sitting alone with the case of jewelry given Cheng by Yuan, and singing from \"Farewell\". Behind him, communist troops begin to file in, and Xiao Si is startled to see them in the mirror.

        "The differences as shown in the elongated TV version [indicated from a 1999 November showing on the Sci-Fi channel] are: - 1. Darkman (Arnold Vosloo) is introduced in the film immediately before the car chase; watching it from above. He then slides down a rope in front of a neon-lit sign. In a series of crosscutting, the car chase ensues as Darkman runs on rooftops. In the DVD/VHS version, Darkman is not introduced until after the car chase ends when the character Steve is shot; followed by a woman's scream. The shot of Darkman swinging down is never featured. The crosscutting of Darkman running only occurs as a gunman flees from the car wrecks. The TV version also features a shot of the policemen apprehending the immobilized gunman after Darkman's remark: \"Thanks for the donation.\" This single shot is absent from the DVD/VHS. - 2. After the scene where Peyton Westlake and Dr. David Brinkman (Jesse Collins) agree to be partners, Brinkman is seen waving off to a jetting Westlake replying solemnly, \"Partners...\" Directly afterward, a wide establishing tracking shot of Westlake's lab is featured. It then cuts to a medium shot of Westlake silently switching on a remote control. A radio is heard during these two shots reporting the weather. In the DVD/VHS version, none of this included. As Westlake jets out of Brinkman's lab, it cuts directly to a shot of Westlake's remote camera running across the floor with Westlake already at the controls. - 3. Westlake, once again in his lab, becomes enraged after reminiscing about what Dr. David Brinkman said to him before his murder. He screams savagely knocking objects off his desk, and then proceeds to run around his lab destroying additional objects. He is then interrupted by the TV's broadcast stating the name, \"Robert Durant...\" which features the character Jill Randall (Kim Delaney) and her live report. This then gives the motivation for Westlake to meet her. In the DVD/VHS version, this bit where he is interrupted by the TV is missing. - 4. When Westlake is confronted by Jill at the post office, the scene ends with a shot of her walking out the door and him in a close up holding up his scarred hands and then putting them to his face. This shot is missing in the DVD/VHS version. - 5. Before the scene where the character Eddie (David Ferry) is knocked out in the bathroom, a medium shot on a street corner shows Eddie stopping to look at his watch, and then him proceeding across the street with a silver briefcase. The shot eventually tilts up to reveal a large office building. In the DVD/VHS version, an exterior shot at the same street corner features the building, but no Eddie at all. It is a different shot because the traffic is not the same. - 6. When Darkman salutes Jill's photo seen on a TV in a store window, a shot shows him walk off with his cart further down to darker parts of the street as Randy Miller's musical score intensifies. The narration starts as the shot dissolves to a silhouette of Darkman looking out towards the city. In the DVD/VHS version, the narration starts at the shot of Darkman saluting, which then dissolves directly to the silhouette. - NOTE: Ordinarily, the intensely violent moments of the film are also removed to fit TV standards [depending on what that particular network allows].",

        "A \"Special Edition\" version was released in 1980 (3 years after the film's original theatrical release). The original production of \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" was plagued with schedule and budget problems. Spielberg originally wanted to release the film in the summer of 1978, however, Columbia Pictures (who were undergoing financial troubles at the time) insisted that Spielberg have it ready by November 1977. Therefore many scenes Spielberg had scripted couldn't be filmed as he originally intended due to time constraints. After the movie's huge success, Spielberg asked Columbia to allow him to re-cut the picture and to shoot additional sequences; the studio agreed at the condition that he included new scenes showing the inside of the alien mothership (to entice audiences into the theater again). Spielberg was given a budget of $1.5 million and seven weeks to shoot the new sequences (some of which were shot while he was also directing 1941 (1979)). He had to use a different director of photography (Allen Daviau) because Vilmos Zsigmond was unavailable, and he was able to convince most of the original cast to re-appear, with the exception of director Francois Truffaut (who played French scientist Lacombe) who was on location shooting a film at the time. For years, Steven Spielberg considered the Special Edition the only \"real\" version of the movie and dismissed the original as an inferior \"work-in-progress\". According to Columbia, all prints of the original version have been destroyed (apart from a few copies kept in the studio's vault for historical value only). Only the Special Edition had been the version available on video until Criterion became the first company to release different versions of the film in any video format. The following are the differences between the Original Version (O.V.) and the Special Edition (S.E.): - In the O.V. after Barry runs outside his house and into the night, there's a cut to a music box playing \"When you wish upon the star\" and then to Roy Neary's house, where he receives a phone call from his boss at the power station. In the S.E. after Barry leaves the house we see a panoramic shot of the city at night instead; the next scene shows Roy playing with a toy train in order to explain to his son what a fraction is. There's an argument between Roy, his wife and his kids (they want to go play Goofy Golf, he wants to go see \"Pinocchio\" but is outvoted). Then Roy's boss calls. - After Jillian Guiler looks for her son Barry in the woods, the O.V. version shows Roy Neary at the power station where workers are discussing the power failures and his supervisor tells him to go check an area of the city. The Special Edition deletes this scene. - The S.E. adds a new scene, after Roy see's the UFO flyby on the road: a UFO stops in front of a McDonald's sign and flashes its light on it, as if to read it. - An old man sees the UFOs fly by on the road and says \"They can fly rings around the moon, but we're years ahead of them on the highway\". This scene is missing from the S.E. - The S.E. adds a scene in which U.S. soldiers and scientists discover the ship, the \"Cotopaxi\" in the Gobi desert. This scene is inserted right after the one where Roy and his wife watch the sky in the spot where he first saw the UFOs. - A scene where Roy and his wife argue right after he's fired from his job. Roy lies on his bed and looks at a pillow (whose shape resembles the Devil's Tower mountain) The pillow segment was removed in the S.E. - The S.E. version changes the chronology of sequences from the mid-section of the O.V. In the O.V. the scene where Roy is fired is followed by the scene where he goes back to the road with his camera, which is followed by The India sequence and then Lacombe's auditorium speech. In the S.E. these scenes are flip-flopped. The scene where Roy is fired is followed by the India sequence, which is followed by Lacombe's auditorium speech, followed by the scene where Roy goes back to the road with his camera. - In the S.E. Lacombe's auditorium speech is slightly longer containing the applause of the dignitaries. - The S.E. deletes a scene at an Air Force base after Lacombe and the military argue about the best way to scare the population away from the alien's landing area. In the original Jillian is interviewed by reporters about her son's kidnapping, and Roy and Ronnie arrive at the base to attend a press conference about UFOs. Roy draws the shape of the Devil's Tower on a newspaper over the photo of Jillian and the headline \"Cosmic Kidnapping\". However, the headline is misspelled as 'kidnaping'. - In the O.V. during the dinner/mashed potato sequence. The scene begins with the kids arguing at the table. As soon as Roy walks into the room they immediately stop shouting. In the S.E. this portion is deleted and the scene begins with Ronnie handing Toby the mashed potatoes. - The S.E. adds a sequence where Roy breaks down and he locks himself in the bathroom and goes under the running shower. Ronnie breaks the door open and yells at him, holding him responsible for their family falling apart. - The scene where Roy tosses bricks and bushes into his house so he can make the Devil's tower replica was almost entirely removed in the S.E. version. The S.E. only includes the portion of the scene where Ronnie actually leaves with the kids. - When Ronnie leaves Roy and almost runs him over with her car, the O.V. shows him getting back inside the house from a window. This scene is missing from the S.E. The sequence when Roy arrives in Wyoming and meets Jillian at the train station while the population is being evacuated by the army is shorter in the S.E.: in the original we saw Roy trying to convince a soldier (played by Carl Weathers) to let him go look for his \"sister\": the guard says he has orders to shoot anyone that trespasses. - The S.E. adds a new ending that shows what happens after Roy enters the mothership, with light/sound special effects by Douglas Trumbull. - In the S.E. the end title music is different. Instead of the closing \"overture\" music originally commissioned for the credits, we hear an arrangement of \"When You Wish Upon A Star\".",

For instance, this is missing the scene where Riva falls out of the truck during the Italian retreat. It is also missing the scene in the Orthodox church prior the Welles addressing the Chetniks. However, it does feature several new scenes, most notably a scene where Vasco raids a house in Prosor only to then shoot and wound his own commander, and then a second battle between the Partisans and the Italians. In this scene, Riva refuses to fire at his own men and Novak almost shoots him only for Martin to intervene. General Morelli is captured and then promptly commits suicide with a pistol. There is also a new scene where the partisans surprise attack a group of Chetniks guarding the Neretva bridge. There are several more violent shots missing from other prints - such as the Ustashans hanging an old woman and laughing when they march through Bihac. There are several more deaths during the end battle with the Chetniks such as a partisan being shot in the back when reaching for a grenade. Then at the end of the battle there is a scene where a partisan named 'Stipe' goes crazy and guns down a number of Chetnik prisoners, only to have his rank stripped from him. Curiously almost all the nationalities speak their own language; with Riva speaking Italian even with his Yugoslavian captors and Morelli speaking in German when addressing General Lohring. The only actors dubbed appear to be Yul Brynner and Orson Welles.",

Police show up soon enough and trap Wadsworth, but not for long. He gets away from the chief and leaves, locking all the people in the mansion. But as he steals a police car, he notices a 'smell' (the dog dropping smell from the beginning of the film) and realizes the Doberman from earlier is now in the police car, and it lunges for him.

As a result of the added narration, the enigmatic ending becomes easier to understand for North American viewers. The added narration actually creates a very large problem with the 'Polish with English subtitles' option on the Region 1 DVD, since the 'traslantion' subtitles are actually dub-titles (they simply transcribed the Enlgish dub as the Polish dialog). This results in innumerable inaccuracies in the script (almost all mention of the connections to the King Arthur myth are lost on any language of the Region 1 version), and the subtitles also show up during the sequences where the English version has narration, meaning that in the middle of a dialog-less scene, the subtitles will show up anyway.

The US DVD release was also heavily cut for an R rating with appreciably different cuts to the UK version which turns out to be the most complete. In the opening scene where Sweet (Matthias Hues) attacks a group of thugs the UK version is the most complete. In the UK version when Hues lifts up and head-butts a thug the camera pans down the thugs face revealing blood pouring from his mouth. In the US DVD the scene cuts away before the camera reaches his mouth. The DVD is also missing several punches to the next thugs ribs. The thug lying on the bed who gets his arm broken is cut identically in both versions. The scene where Dillon (Don Wilson) enters the dead prostitutes room is cut in the UK version. In the DVD we see a close up shot of the woman lying on the bed which is cut from the UK tape. The scene where the thugs attack Shanna's house is cut on the DVD. The knife wielding thug that attacks Dillon get his arm broken in the UK tape before he is thrown through the table. On the DVD the arm break is missing. The scene where Sweet attacks the two men on the street has been cut for the UK version. We should see Sweet lift up the first thug and head-butt him but this is missing from the UK tape (but surprisingly a photo of that exact scene is printed on the back of the tape). The scene where Sweet kills Dillons partner is cut on both versions. Close up punches to the face have been cut from the UK version. Sweet breaking the mans neck has been cut differently on both versions. In the UK version Sweet grabs the mans head and says 'Time to...' but the remaining dialogue (presumably 'Time to die') is missing and the man is lying on the floor with his neck broken. The DVD is also missing the neck break but all of the 'Time to die' dialogue is also missing. The final martial arts scene in Dillon's apartment has been cut differently in both versions. All scenes showing Nunchaku sticks have been cut from the UK version. Various snippets of martial arts have been cut from both versions. The scene showing Sweet impaled on a sword has been cut from the DVD. In the UK version the camera pans down showing Sweet staggering about with the sword impaled through his chest and blood pouring from his mouth.

        "This film was re-released in IMAX and other large format theaters on January 1, 2002. The following changes were made to the film for this release: - The \"In Association with Silver Screen Partners IV\" credit is replaced with \"The Special Edition Of--\" on the opening title sequence. The 2002 DVD omits this credit & the Walt Disney Pictures Presents credit stays on screen. - The animation in some of the scenes went back through the clean-up animation department a second time, to correct problems such as wavering lines and missing details, which, while not very noticeable during a traditional 35mm showing of the film, would have been discomforting on a much large IMAX screen. Small details, such as the blood in Beast's wound after his fight with the wolves, were also added. - The Beast's \"stutter\" (\"You wan-wanna stay in the tower?\"), a sound editing mistake, was corrected (\"You wanna stay in the tower?\"). - Six minutes of new footage was added between the songs \"Something There\" and \"Beauty and the Beast,\" most of which is made up of a new musical sequence, \"Human Again.\" This song was written by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken for the original version of the film, but cut for continuity purposes. After Alan Menken altered the song to make it work for the Broadway stage version of Beauty and the Beast, the song was worked back into the film. - During the \"Human Again\" song sequence, the household objects clean up the Beast's castle, which necessitated having the background artists go back and digitally re-paint the backgrounds for the castle scenes that followed so that the castle was clean. - The animation for Cogsworth's line to the Beast after Belle is freed (\"Yes-yes-yes, but...why?\") was completely re-done, as the directors never liked how the animation looked in the original version. - New sound effects are added to the shot where Belle and Phillippe leave the castle to find Maurice, which are supposed to suggest that the Beast trashes his room in anguish (and also so that the backgrounds from this point on would not have to be repainted). - The longer credits necessitated the addition of an additional passage of score music, the version of the 'Transformation' theme that was cut out of the original film, to the end of the film.",

This credits sequence features all of the credits from the original 1962 episodes, as well as the first season of the new 1985 episodes, all lumped together (unlike what H-B did to _\"Flintstones, The\" (1960)_ (qv)--see the alternate versions listing for that series--these credits are not technically incorrect). The new 1987-88 syndication season features different credits (but the same basic credits *sequence*) as the 1985 version. In 1995, Turner started broadcasting and distributing prints that retained the original \"Jane! Stop this crazy thing!\" end titles.",

Also Inspector Gadget was given a geeky assistant, Corporal Capeman who appeared off and on and was removed for half the season. The episodes also went in parts of three.

The Ultimate Edition also includes several deleted scenes: - when Conan and Subotai first enter the village, they are shown stopping by a vendor (played by director John Milius) selling lizard-on-a-stick. The vendor says, \"Want food? This is on a stick...fresh. Quick, there are many to feed!\" Shortly thereafter in the film, Conan remarks that the food is good, to which Subotai replies, \"You have no idea how long it's been there!\" - a scene of silhouettes on a wall fighting - a cut scene of King Osric being attacked and killed in his throne-room by (presumably) Doom's soldiers - another cut scene of King Osric's demise, shot from a different angle, which ends with him staring at the reflection of his dying self in a mirror astride the throne, which he then shatters with his sword before collapsing An outtake is also included that takes place just after Conan is freed from bondage, and is climbing the rocks leading to the Atlantean General's tomb, and is being pursued by wild dogs. As Arnold is climbing, one of the dogs reaches him, biting him, and a crew member runs on-screen to intervene as Arnold shouts \"Goddamnit!\" in pain.",

This version is available as a bootleg. A full list of scenes cut are: - The scene where they are in the shop in the beginning is removed from the \"uncut\" version and is replaced with an extended scene of them driving the truck through the woods. Then they stop when Burt says he left something back at the store and they have a longer conversation about the map. - The scene of Rider Strong going behind the building to wash his hands after Dennis's bite and he pets the stray dogs is removed from the \"uncut\" version. - A different angle of Jordan Ladd's character Karen swimming away after the \"kiss\" scene on the dock with Rider Strong. - When it is discovered that Karen has the disease during an intimate scene, there is an additional scene that follows the \"Don't...Leave...Me!\" where Burt comes into the room and yells at her about how the truck isn't ready yet, and they have to finish cleaning up the bum's blood. - An extended scene of everyone arguing around the fireplace when Burt makes a joke about his burnt marshmallow. - A scene of Burt sitting outside guarding the shed with his shot gun. This immediatly follows when they hear the dog trying to get Karen in the shed and they shoot a bullet and tell Karen that they will stay outside with her to keep the dog away. - The gunshot to Burt's head in the cabin is bloodier. In the \"R\" rated version it cuts away quick and only shows the aftermath from a difficult-to-see angle. - An additional scene where Rider Strong grabs the long-haired hick after the attack and drags him down to the celler. He yells at the hick as he throws him down there and says \"When they get here, tell them I didn't do it!\", then slams the door. - The human-bonfire scene when they say \"We got another one in the basement\" immediatly goes to a shot of the celler door opening from the inside, then a bunch of shotguns appear and start shooting like crazy. We see blood all over the walls. Then they pour gasoline and one cop lights a match and celler goes up in flames followed by more shots of blood and guts on the walls, ceiling, and floor. - The end is switched around a little. Instead of just the cops drinking the contaminated lemonade followed by a country song with the townspeople, the whole entie town shows up and has a cup. There is additional dialoug amoung the townspeople, different shots, and it shows the FDA man walking around more testing and the Water supply truck is in view longer. - That is every scene that is changed or cut from the Lions Gate release.",

At the bar with his friends, he saves a young woman from being hit by a man by fighting him. However, he gets thrown out by the doorman at the backlane. The two men then approach him to tell him about his twin Tommy's demise and the proposal of taking over. There's a close-up of a dead Tommy slowly consumed by the incinerator fire and it morphs to Jake at the spaceship as to point out them being twins. Due to that, the close-up (serves as the bookmark of the original opening and ending) of Jake opening his eyes on the ship has been removed. - Before taking off to Pandora, an extra line of the pilot has been added: \"Copy, Venture Star. Go for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4 niner.\" - The next two additions deal more about the abandoned school scene in the Special Edition. The first one happens when Grace considers a picture of Neytiri that Jake brought out, she starts to wallow in memories. about her twin Sylwanin. She reveals her dead, obviously killed by the mercenaries as well as Norm once had a relationship with her. - The second addition: After Grace insists Jake to have a meal, he sees a picture of Grace teaching a few Na'vi at school, two of them being a young Neytiri and her twin Sylwanin. She describes what happened on the day Sylwanin was killed and how the school was abandoned. - After the marines vacate the lab and prepare for retaliation, there is an extension by Grace which obviously reveals that the marines wanted and planned for a war with the Na'vi. The small sequence that happens in the theatrical version after that was removed. - There is also the alternative Family-friendly audio track, which substitutes profanity words with a more clean words.
