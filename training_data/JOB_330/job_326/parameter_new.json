The differences are as follows (includes Spoilers): - In the PG-13 version, Shannon Elizabeth's character Becky is simply dragged away by the wolf at the end of the opening sequence. In the unrated version, Becky is torn in half and her bloodied upper-torso is tossed back at Jimmy and Ellie. - In the PG-13 version, during Ellie's nightmare, she merely bites Joshua Jackson's character Jake in the neck. The scene then cuts to a quick montage of bizarre images before Ellie wakes up. In the unrated version, after Ellie bites into Jake, she's shown ripping a large chunk of his neck off and then a torrent of blood shoots out of his wound. - In the PG-13 version, after Joanie knocks out Jake she starts looking for Ellie and Jimmy. In the unrated version, she first stops by Kyle's body, digs into the large gash in his stomach with her hands, pulls them out and then licks his blood off her fingers before proceeding to look for Ellie and Jimmy. - In the unrated version, Joanie (in wolf form) is killed when she is shot in the head and her brains slowly ooze onto the floor. - In the PG-13 version, the coroner discovers that Joanie's corpse has changed back into human form when her nude body is shown laying on the floor. In the unrated version, a sheet over her body is pulled back and only her face, complete with a bullet hole in her forehead, is shown. - In the PG-13 version, Jake's death by decapitation occurs off-camera.

        "SPOILER: The original British Thorn EMI VHS release, when compared to the 2005 Mosaic DVD appears to have many scenes that were not merely edited for censorship but were different takes used in a 'tamer' version. Most obvious is the scene where Patsy introduces Sally to the gang as a potential prostitute. In the original Thorn EMI release she remains fully clothed throughout and when Fallon is asked if he wants to 'check out this piece of merchandise' him and Sally simply walk off screen. In the 2005 DVD Sally undresses in front of the gang at Patsy's insistence and is naked when Fallon approaches her. Another scene that was a different take is when Norris kills Fallon in the woodwork lab. In the Thorn EMI release he simply pushes Fallon back over the saw blade killing him almost instantly. In the 2005 DVD he cuts off Fallon's right arm first, Fallon then staggers upright and THEN Norris pushes him back on the blade. Other scenes cut completely and now reinstated are: - The entire fight with Joo Joo's gang. - The rape scene - Barnyard, Patsy and Drugstore finding Fallon's body - Drugstore's death scene (more close ups of his body) - Norris hitting Barnyard more times on the head with the pipe. - Stegman cutting Diane's breasts before fighting Norris. Also the 2005 DVD has written prologue and epilogue. The prologue states the amount of attacks on staff in US High Schools and states that 'no high school is as bad as Lincoln High....yet'. The epilogue states that 'Andy Norris was never prosecuted as the police couldn't find anyone who actually saw it.",

In this scene, he climbs up a frozen waterfall.  The scene which would have followed this was the one in the theatrical version where Stallone reaches the top of the mountain and runs to the lodge to meet Jessie.  According to Renny Harlin, the scene was cut because it didn't look real enough...the waterfall was a fiberglass wall and the background was optically inserted.  Also, they didn't want Stallone's character to appear invincible and be able to do anything, like in Rambo. - The second deleted scene is called \"King's Leap\" and occurs right after the scene where the bridge which connects the two mountain faces is destroyed. In this scene, Stallone does a running jump between the two mountain faces, and safely lands on the wall of the opposing cliff.  According to Renny Harlin, this was also cut because while climbers actually jump between mountain faces, the jump they had Stallone doing was a little to far to be believable.  They then got around the part of how Gabe & Jessie got around the mountain by having them backtrack and go all the way around.  Some audio was also re-recorded for that after the \"King's Leap\" was cut.. - Portions of both deleted scenes can be seen in the trailer for the movie",

In the Director's Cut, this scene runs longer, with Cindy asking Matrix about Jenny's mother, who Matrix says died in childbirth. He then laments how he has missed all the important moments of her life due to his work around the world. Cindy asks him why he had to do so much traveling, and what he did, to which he replies, \"Things you don't want to know about. Things that sometimes I wish I didn't know about. But that part of my life is over with, all that matters to me now is Jenny.\" - The tool-shed scene is longer, and contains several very brief new shots of soldiers being killed in various ways. Included amongst the new material is a brief close up of a rake piercing a soldier's belly, a shot of a saw-blade slicing a soldier's neck, a shot of the soldier who is hit in the groin with the axe grimacing in pain, and a shot of the soldier touching the stump of his arm after Matrix has cut it off.",

        "The Anchor Bay special edition DVD, released in 2002, contains six deleted scenes (a couple of which also appear on the LD), cut by Ken Russell for pacing, time and conventionality reasons, and some brief additional dialogue during the China Blue/Adrian car ride. The six scenes, which have optional commentary by Barry Sandler noting why they were removed, are: - An additional barbecue scene with Bobby and Donny reminiscing about screwing the loosest girl in high school (whom everyone was lining up to screw). Bobby confesses that he never went through with it, because he had just started seeing Amy. Amy and Sheila (Yvonne McCord) then have a discussion in the garage about unhappy marriages and unexciting lives. Sheila admits that the happiest time of her life was when she left Donny, Amy tells her that Bobby tries so hard to make things work, and Sheila advises her to dump him and stop wasting his time. This was bracketed in the film by the limo scene with China Blue, Arthur and Claudia. (5m 11s) - Joanna and Bobby lie in bed post-coitus. She has her doubts about letting her cover down, a fight erupts, and he storms out of her apartment to go stay at Donny's. (2m 3s) - Joanna knocks on Bobby's door, as she now needs him. She wants to try again, and he's happy to comply. Appeared in the film after Joanna leaves Ben's (Gerald S. O'Loughlin) and Adrian's (Peggy Feury) house. (1m 4s) - Joanna sits in her car, parked outside the Grady family home, so she can see how his other side lives. Amy drives home with Jimmy, tells him to go wait inside, chides Joanna (aware that she's the other woman) for daring to come to her house, and both women spill their guts. Appeared in the film in between the scenes of Joanna slamming the door in Bobby's face after their reconciliation and Amy giving Bobby his old football jersey. (2m 53s) - Bobby enters Jimmy's bedroom and helps him with a diorama of the solar system. He tells his son that he's not staying, and Jimmy begs him to, because he promised he would be. Appeared in the film after the scene where Amy gives Bobby his old football jersey. (1m 20s) - Bobby shares a drink in a bar with a very drunk Donny. He tells Donny about Joanna and that he just said goodbye to Amy and the kids, before he heads off to see Joanna. Donny then tries and fails to pick up a woman, who's revolted by him. Appeared in the film in the middle of Reverend Shayne's attack on Joanna. (2m 53s) Some versions, such as the Anchor Bay DVD, have the \"It's a Lovely Life\" video out of sync with the music, and the camera's-eye views of Bobby filming China Blue and Reverend Shayne in B&W (which is how they are in the longform music video), instead of blue-tint. For some odd reason, the DVD removes the New World Pictures copyright ((c)Copyright 1984 New World Pictures All Rights Reserved.) in the end credits, replacing it with a cheap video insert ((c)1984 New World Pictures. All Rights Reserved.) after all the credits have rolled.",

They are ambushed by Nazis, who kill the two spies before Cap finishes them all off. Cap then holds the dying female spy in his arms and is reminded of his girlfriend, Bernie, back in the United States. - There is an additional scene which explores the character of the Red Skull more, and it attempts to make him look much more like a tragic figure, haunted by his painful past. In the 1990's, as Steve Rogers is reviewing the deaths of Martin Luther King and John Kennedy and realizing that the Red Skull is to blame, the Red Skull is shown weeping over the piano seen at the end of the film, re-living the visitation of the Italian army storming into his house, shooting his family, and kidnapping him for their experiments.

        "The R2 Special Edition (available on the Alien Quadrology Boxset as well as separately) contains 7 extra minutes of altered and/or extended scenes. As a result, there is a little more character development, but the music has also been re-edited (a bit poorly) in some scenes. Here follows a short description: - The main titles (the distorted shots of the 7 early Ripley clones in the theatrical cut) have been replaced by an alternate opening, which starts with a close-up of a growling alien mouth. As the camera pulls back, it is revealed to be the beak of a fly, that is subsequently squashed by a thumb of a soldier. The soldier uses a straw to blow the fly's blood against a window, which shows that he is actually sitting in a nacell of the Auriga spaceship. The rest of the shot shows the Auriga slowly flying away from camera. - Directly after the chestburster has been surgically removed from Ripley 8, she wakes up from her narcosis, grips the surgeon's arm and breaks it. - In the scene where Ripley is shown drawings of a glove and fruit, directly after Genral Perez, Wren and Gediman leave, the doctor shows Ripley a drawing of a young, blond girl, which seems to trigger an emotional memory in her. - During the meal scene, Ripley repeats Gediman's 'Fiori 16', and he asks her what she remembers. Dr. Wren can also tells some more about the Weyland-Yutani company (\"bought up by Wall-Mart\") - The 'Betty introduction scene has been completely re-edited and extended. The scene now starts with the Betty flying towards the Auriga, Elgyn giving the clearance code over the radio (E-A-T-M-E), but now he flirts some more with Hillard, and warns Call and Vriess over the intercom to get ready. Next, Call and Vriess are shown working on the cargo, followed by some extended dialogue in which Vriess tells Call an obscene joke. This is followed by the scene in which Christie gets his hidden weapons (which came first in the original cut). Next is Johner's 'target practice', Vriess then throws a tool to his head, Call calls him names, but Johner simply replies by asking for his knife. When Vriess comments on his alcoholism, Johner demans his knife back, Call breaks it, Johner threatens her, and there is an extra line from Vriess that he and Cal deserve better company. - During the deal between Elgyn and Perez, Elgyn has some more 'flattering' remarks about Call, thinking Vriess has an eye on her. After Elgyn asks Perez for three days bed and board, Perez agrees under a few conditions (no tresspassing in restricted areas, no trouble, no fighting). - After Purvis shouts \"What's in-f###ing-side me?!?\", Wren answers: \"A parasite! A foreign element!\" After Call says that Purvis can be frozen and operated later, she has another run-in with Johner, followed by Christie agreeing that Purvis comes, but saying he will shoot him if he starts acting funny. - Just before everyone takes a dive through the flooded kitchen, Christie and DiStephano have a short conversation on Christie's weapons ('the disposable kind'), and Call reminds everyone to take a deep breath. - In the chapel, just after Purvis' fake chestburst, there is an extended line from Call, stating she recalibrated ground level, sending the ship into an uninhabited quadrant of Earth, before she mentions time of impact. After Ripley asks if she's the new a##hole model, she replies she couldn't let humanity annihilate itself. Ripley comments that she once tried to save people as well; she remembers a girl that had bad dreams, but she died despite her help, and now she can't even remember her name. After DiStephano enters to take them with him, Ripley asks Call if she dreams, which Call does thanks to neural processors; Ripley says she dreams about the aliens every night, and that she used to be afraid, but not anymore, since it is always worse when she wakes up. - After Johner kissed Vriess for getting them safely through Earth's atmosphere, there is an alternate ending with the Betty landing on Earth. Call warns Ripley for the military that will come looking for her soon. She says someone can get pretty lost on Earth, and asks Ripley what to do. Ripley replies that she doesn't know, since she is a stranger there herself. The camera then goes up, to reveal a post-apocalyptical Paris.",

(1:24) - We see Douzi being carried atop the servant's back to Old Man Zhang's quarters (0:09) - During the \"deflowering scene\" with Old Man Zhang, after the woman leaves, until Zhang says \"Come here.\" Douzi urinates into a vase, as the old man looks on, getting quite excited. (0:21) - After Cheng and Duan are accosted by rioting students, after the photo session. They are being carted through the streets on handcarts. Na Kun is following, on foot. They discuss first the student revolutionaries, and then the incident at Old Man Zhang's house, which is now a coffin shop. Dieyi mentions that he was there the day before; Na conjectures that he was probably looking for the sword. (0:51) - After Cheng and Duan meet Yuan Shiqing for the first time, and Cheng is presented with jewelry. Brief dialogue as Yuan and then Duan leave the room. (0:19) - After Cheng and Duan argue in the makeup room, right before Juxian leaves the House of Blossoms. Juxian watches a performance of \"Farewell\". (0:55) - After Cheng and Duan argue during the \"engagement\" scene, right before Cheng tucks the baby Xiao Si into bed. Yuan presents Cheng with an elaborate pheasant headdress in his dressing room. (0:51) - After Japan's march into Beijing, right before Duan gets into a fight with the Japanese. Another opera scene, dealing with drink. Also one line of dialogue as Juxian applies Duan's makeup. (1:31) - Scene of Cheng singing to Japanese continues, right before Duan is released. Interior shots, Cheng holding a fan. Music, and applause. (0:47) - More graphic detail in the bloodletting scene. - Brief shot of Duan caressing Juxian's cheek, right after Cheng and Yuan makeup scene. - After our first glance of Cheng smoking opium, right before Cheng and Duan visit their old teacher. Cheng steps out of his home, smoking and looking quite listless. He chokes as a car passes. Then we see Juxian showing a group of Duan's friends to the exit of their home, recovering money that her husband has lent them. Juxian complains that Duan doesn't have a real job; Duan responds that all he can do is sing, and Juxian has forbidden that. Juxian mentions that Duan and Cheng's old teacher wants to see them; Duan says that he is too ashamed to face him. (2:02) - After Juxian visits Cheng in his cell, just before trial. Beginning of the trial dialogue cut, where Peking Opera is described as \"pornographic music\", and the formal charges of collusion with the Japanese Officer, Aoki, are described. (0:43) - Later, in the same trial scene, after Na's \"testimony\", Yuan objects to the idea of Peking Opera as \"pornographic music\".  (1:01) - After the communists march into Beijing, Cheng and Duan are performing \"Farewell\" to an audience of communist troops. The troops do not respond, and then break into a patriotic song afterwards. Xiao Si seems to take to their philosophy. This scene cuts into what seems to be one large crowd scene in the U.S. release -- everything depicting Xiao Si (the foundling) skipping through the streets of Beijing comes after this scene. (1:52) - After Juxian's suicide, and before we cut to the present day, we get a short scene where the traitorous Xiao Si seems to get his due. He is sitting alone with the case of jewelry given Cheng by Yuan, and singing from \"Farewell\". Behind him, communist troops begin to file in, and Xiao Si is startled to see them in the mirror. One of them approaches and hands him what seems to be some sort of summons. (1:11)",

        "The differences as shown in the elongated TV version [indicated from a 1999 November showing on the Sci-Fi channel] are: - 1. Darkman (Arnold Vosloo) is introduced in the film immediately before the car chase; watching it from above. He then slides down a rope in front of a neon-lit sign. In a series of crosscutting, the car chase ensues as Darkman runs on rooftops. In the DVD/VHS version, Darkman is not introduced until after the car chase ends when the character Steve is shot; followed by a woman's scream. The shot of Darkman swinging down is never featured. The crosscutting of Darkman running only occurs as a gunman flees from the car wrecks. The TV version also features a shot of the policemen apprehending the immobilized gunman after Darkman's remark: \"Thanks for the donation.\" This single shot is absent from the DVD/VHS. - 2. After the scene where Peyton Westlake and Dr. David Brinkman (Jesse Collins) agree to be partners, Brinkman is seen waving off to a jetting Westlake replying solemnly, \"Partners...\" Directly afterward, a wide establishing tracking shot of Westlake's lab is featured. It then cuts to a medium shot of Westlake silently switching on a remote control. A radio is heard during these two shots reporting the weather. In the DVD/VHS version, none of this included. As Westlake jets out of Brinkman's lab, it cuts directly to a shot of Westlake's remote camera running across the floor with Westlake already at the controls. - 3. Westlake, once again in his lab, becomes enraged after reminiscing about what Dr. David Brinkman said to him before his murder. He screams savagely knocking objects off his desk, and then proceeds to run around his lab destroying additional objects. He is then interrupted by the TV's broadcast stating the name, \"Robert Durant...\" which features the character Jill Randall (Kim Delaney) and her live report. This then gives the motivation for Westlake to meet her. In the DVD/VHS version, this bit where he is interrupted by the TV is missing. - 4. When Westlake is confronted by Jill at the post office, the scene ends with a shot of her walking out the door and him in a close up holding up his scarred hands and then putting them to his face. This shot is missing in the DVD/VHS version. - 5. Before the scene where the character Eddie (David Ferry) is knocked out in the bathroom, a medium shot on a street corner shows Eddie stopping to look at his watch, and then him proceeding across the street with a silver briefcase. The shot eventually tilts up to reveal a large office building. In the DVD/VHS version, an exterior shot at the same street corner features the building, but no Eddie at all. It is a different shot because the traffic is not the same. - 6. When Darkman salutes Jill's photo seen on a TV in a store window, a shot shows him walk off with his cart further down to darker parts of the street as Randy Miller's musical score intensifies. The narration starts as the shot dissolves to a silhouette of Darkman looking out towards the city. In the DVD/VHS version, the narration starts at the shot of Darkman saluting, which then dissolves directly to the silhouette. - NOTE: Ordinarily, the intensely violent moments of the film are also removed to fit TV standards [depending on what that particular network allows].",

There is a voice-over by a reporter on this. Barbara then hears this reporter, who is on her TV, announce Selina has been murdered and goes to the door where she is shot by Joker. The aired version is edited differently. It starts with footage of Batman fighting Joker, then has a shot of Helena and Selina Kyle walking together that wasn't in the previous version. It then adds new footage of Batman and Catwoman fighting. It then cuts to Barbara Gordon's apartment, intercut with footage of her fighting. It cuts directly from her in the shower to her opening the door, where she is shot by Joker. The whole thing has new narration by Alfred Pennyworth. - The most obvious difference is that Harley Quinn was recast. Scenes originally shot with 'Sherilyn Fenn' (qv) were reshot with 'Mia Sara' (qv). - There a few alternate scenes involving Barbara Gordon, including one that indicates her involvement with a fellow teacher has been going on for six months.

This second hit has been removed. - When Matrix breaks Henriques' ('Charles Meshack' (qv)) neck on the plane, he simply elbows him, and in the next shot, Henrqiues is already dead.

Charlie crashes into a tree as the main title credits are seen (as we have all been familiar with over the years). However, all current prints do not show us what happens to Linus...in the uncut version, Linus crashes into a Coca-Cola sign (indicating the show's sponsor). Also, after the final credits (while the Peanuts gang sing \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing\"), there is a subtitle that says \"Merry Christmas from your local Coca-Cola bottler\". Due to subsequent FCC laws precluding sponsor plugs in the context of children's programs, these two elements have been edited out of all current prints (even in the so-called \"uncut\" versions shown over the past three years on CBS, as well as all home video releases from Paramount and Warner Bros.).",

        "A 113 minute 70mm workprint was shown at the some sneak previews in Dallas and Denver in 1982. The film scored extremely poorly from the test audiences, and it was this poor reaction which led to the happy ending and the voice-over narration. In 1989, sound preservationist 'Michael Arick' (qv) came across a 70mm print of Blade Runner in the TODD-AO vaults. Thinking it was the International Cut, Arick purchased the print for Warners, who loaned it out to the Los Angeles Cineplex-Odeon Fairfax Theatre in 1990 for a festival of 70mm prints. It was at this screening that people realized they were watching the Dallas/Denver Workprint. The film was subsequently screened at UCLA's Los Angeles Perspectives Multimedia Festival in 1991. A 35mm reduction of this version was later shown at the NuArt Theatre and the Art Deco Castro Theater in San Francisco in 1991. It was the success of these four screenings that prompted Warner Bros. to look into the possibility of releasing a Director's Cut of the film. The workprint briefly resurfaced again, by accident, for a one-week engagement (1/15 - 1/21) at the Seattle, WA Landmark Egyptian Theater in 1999. However, this print was the one-of-a-kind 70mm blow-up, directly from the Warner Bros. vault. In 2007, the workprint was made available to the public for the first time on disc 5 of the 5-disc Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD/HD-DVD/Blu-ray Disc of the film (which also contains the US theatrical cut, the European cut, the Director's Cut and the Final Cut). The differences between the workprint and the other versions include: - The logo for the Ladd Company is on a white background, not a black background. - The title screen for the film is different, with the words 'BLADE RUNNER' sliding onto the screen accompanied by the sound of knives. - New American Dictionary (2016) definition of a replicant is used in lieu of the opening credit crawl. - The opening shots do not include the close-up and subsequent pull-away from the eye seen in all other cuts, it simply cuts closer and closer to the Tyrell building. Additionally, the shot moving into towards the window is absent, as are two interior wide shots of Holden standing at the window. Throughout the scene, air-traffic control headings can be heard. - After Leon shoots Holden and he crashes through the wall, hitting the table, the shot stays on Holden as fan blades brush his hair and his back smokes from the gunfire. - Deckard's meal at \"The White Dragon\" can be seen being laid on the bar in front of him, rather than merely being heard. Additionally, the shot of Deckard rubbing his chopsticks together is longer. Also, as Gaff speaks to Deckard, the shot remains on Deckard rather than cutting to Gaff, showing Deckard having some difficulty eating his noodles. - As Deckard and Gaff are flying to the police station, in all versions of the film, you can see Gaff speaking to Deckard, but in the Workprint you can actually hear what he says. - During the briefing, the shot of Bryant getting a bottle and pouring two drinks is absent. Also missing is Bryant's line \"I need the old Blade Runner, I need your magic.\" - Bryant says \"two\" replicants were fried running through an electric field instead of one.\" - When looking at the incept tapes, Bryant comments on Leon's ability to work all day and night. - As Gaff and Deckard approach the Tyrell building, there is more air traffic control heard. - When Rachael asks Deckard if she can ask him a personal question, Deckard responds \"Sure. What is it?\" In all other versions of the film, he simply says \"Sure.\" - When Deckard and Gaff inspect Leon's address and the attendant opens the room for them, he mutters \"Kowalski\". - After Chew tells Roy that J.F. Sebastian will take him to Tyrell, the shot where Roy leans forward and says, \"Now, where will we find this J.F. Sebastian?\" is missing. - After Rachael has left Deckard's apartment, and he walks out onto the balcony, there is the sound of a police siren, which is absent in all other cuts. - When Deckard plays the piano in a depressed stupor: a) there is no unicorn vision, b) there is no background music, and c) we hear one or two notes Harrison Ford actually played on the set. - A whirring sound comes from the Esper that is absent in all other versions. - After zooming in on the shot of Roy in the photo, Deckard can be heard to say \"Hello Roy.\" Then, after printing the hardcopy, he says \"Zhora or Pris?\" - When Deckard gives the snake scale to the Cambodian lady, she says \"It will take a moment.\" - Deckard's search for Abdul Hassan lasts longer: we see more of Animoid Row and the back streets of the sector. As Deckard moves away from the Cambodian lady, there is an eighteen second crane shot showing Deckard disappearing into the crowd. - The dialogue heard during the scene with Hassan matches perfectly with the lip movements. - As Deckard nears Taffy Lewis' club, there is a twelve second crane shot showing the geography of the street. - There is a shot of two dancers in hockey masks outside Taffy's bar. - There is a shot of Deckard asking for directions to Taffy Lewis' from a uniformed policeman. - The audio-only introduction of 'Miss Salome' is slightly different. - There is a close-up shot of Deckard examining a sequin from Zhora's costume. - After Zhora attacks Deckard and flees, we see Deckard loosen his tie from his throat. - \"If I Didn't Care\" by the Ink Spots, is in the background when Deckard purchases a bottle of Tsing Tao, instead of \"One More Kiss, Dear.\" - After Rachael shoots Leon, the shot of him falling forward onto Deckard is absent, as is the shot of Rachael lowering the gun and stepping forward. - In Deckard's apartment, there is no \"Love Theme\"; the initial music track merely continues on longer. Also, Rachel plays a different selection on the piano when testing herself, and the shot of her undoing her hair and letting it floor to her shoulders is missing. - Roy says to Tyrell, \"I want more life, father\". - When Roy kills Tyrell, the footage is the same as in the International version, showing Roy's thumbs going into Tyrell's eyes and blood spurting out. Additionally, when Roy turns to Sebastian, he says \"I'm sorry, Sebastian. Come. Come\", as he walks towards him. As Sebastian turns to run, he can be heard whimpering. - Bryant's info to Deckard over the CB about Tyrell's and Sebastian's deaths are heard as we see Deckard driving through the tunnel. When Deckard is parked in his sedan on the street, he is merely preparing to call J.F.'s apartment before the police spinner interrogates him. Also, when the spinner arrives, we hear police sirens. - During the fight between, Pris and Deckard, we see Pris lift him up by the nostrils. - When Deckard shoots Pris, he shoots 3 times instead of 2. - There is the sound of a thunderclap as Roy examines Pris' body. - We actually see Roy break Deckard's fingers, in a split second close up, with a prop-hand. Also, the shot when Deckard pops his fingers back in is taken from a different angle, and Deckard's scream is much quieter than in all other versions of the film. - There are more shots of Roy running through the Bradbury. - When Roy pushes his head through the wall, there is an extra line; \"You're not in pain are you? Are you in pain?\" - There are more shots of Deckard as he climbs to the roof, and also more shots of him as he hangs on to the neighboring building. - The music during the chase is completely different from the music of Vangelis (according to 'Paul Sammon' (qv), the music used is from old soundtracks by 'James Horner' (qv) and 'Jerry Goldsmith' (qv)). - Different, farther-away shots of Roy as Deckard watches him die. Additionally, there is an alternate narration (the only narration in this version): \"I watched him die all night. It was a long, slow thing and he fought it all the way. He never whimpered and he never quit. He took all the time he had as though he loved life very much. Every second of it...even the pain. Then, he was dead.\" - Deckard's movement through his apartment as he searches for Rachael is different, with a wide shot of him scanning the room. The overall scene is approximately 20 seconds shorter than in all other versions - The shot of Deckard telling Rachael to wait before leaving the apartment is missing. - There is no happy ending, the film ends when the elevator doors slam. - There are no end credits, merely exit music for about a minute: the same cue heard as when Gaff takes Deckard to see Bryant at the start of the movie.",

Esteban's run in the city to the tavern is shorter, but an additional overhead shot is shown. The scene in which Pedro and Sancho are telling the story about the city of gold is shortened (they don't talk about how the patrons of the bar should invest in their adventure.) There is an additional scene of Esteban looking shocked when the official says \"find him and you'll receive a whole piece of gold.\" There is a scene difference in when Mendoza is waiting for Esteban at the dock, he waits longer, but Esteban's run to meet him is shorter. The ending of Episode 1 is omitted in that Esteban discovers Zia only. The scene in which Mendoza smiles at the discovery that Esteban makes of Zia, and the both looking to see the clouds turn into the winged serpent forshadowing things to come is not there. - Episode 2: The daydreaming scene in which the golden butterflies turns into the city of gold is omitted, as well as the daydreaming scene in which Esteban is seasick and floating above the mayan ruins. - Episode 3: The daydreaming scene of the seamonster eating the ship is omitted. - Episode 4: Has the longest runtime of all the episodes of the series contains many additions, cuts, and an alternate ending. Additions include Extended footage of Mendoza rescuing the children with Esteban grabbing onto him through the bars so he doesn't get sucked out, followed by Dialogue of Gomez on the deck of the ship saying something about Gaspard. Gomez then slides down the deck of the ship and gets into the boat. There is a scene added in which Pedro and Sancho wake up in each others arms on the deck of the Esperanza when Esteban calls to Mendoza about the St. Elmos fire. There is also an extended scene after the shark attack where Pedro and Sancho say something off camera, and goes into an on camera dialogue with Esteban and Zia's dialogue about Esteban's father. - Omitted scene: There is a small scene of the raft sitting still in the sunlight. - Alternate Ending: Once the Island is discovered our heroes merely paddle their way toward the island, seeing shots of the lizards, and shots of the island. The Episode ends right here, and the entire footage in the English/French versions of Mendoza swimming from the sharks is gone. - Some of the scenes from Episode 4 alternate ending and the rescue can be seen in the English/French version Previous and To Follow segments - Episode 5: This starts where the English/French Episode 4 ends at the raft on the island. There is a scene omission of Zia lifting her dress to sit down. This Episode ends right where Tao points the crossbow at Esteban. - Episode 6: Starts in the tree house right where Episode 5 left off, and has a small scene of Mendoza Pedro and Sancho arriving on the raft. From this point forward all Episodes are in Synch with the English/French versions, with very few differences. - Episode 9: Starts with an additional second of footage zoomed in on the Solaris's sail - Episode 27: Has a second of footage containing a lightning bolt omitted at the start of the Episode - Episode 29: In the Japanese version when Esteban Tao and Zia are struck by the Olmec ray, Esteban spins around much slower and the background isn't changed as much. - Closing Credits: There is an additional bit of animation used of the sun and then transitioning to Esteban's face - None of the previous, to follows, or live action documentaries are on the Japanese DVD's",

In the work print he takes two bloody bullet hits in the back and then there is another shot of 3 more coming out of his chest and as he falls to the ground you can see another shot of him from behind taking another 3 hits before hitting the ground. - In the R rated version Evan is fired upon and doesn't appear to be hit until Frank finds him later. In the work print Kynette forces Travers shoot at Evan you then see Evan take a bullet through the shoulder in slow-motion which explains why he appears to have been shot when Frank finds him later on. - The fight between Gabe and Kynette has been shortened for the R rated version which misses shots of Gabe and Jessie being beaten further after Kynette asks for the *third* time where the money is (this is missing in the R rated version which leads to a continuity error as he said he would ask three times)The impaling of Kynette has been shortened, in the work print there is more focus on Kynette's eyes going back into his head and Gabe gritting his teeth holding Kynette up on the stalagmite as he is dying before finally dropping him. - When Hal and Delmar fight the R rated version has removed a shot of Delmar kicking Hal hard in the kidneys and saying \"Tell me how are we feeling so far?\" as opposed to the R rated version \"Tell me do you like soccer\" they have been edited together and this now explains why Delmar appears out of breath when he asks the soccer question. - When Hal shoots Delmar with the shotgun in the work print you see Craig Fairbrass get shot with a large splatter of blood behind him and a bloody shotgun wound to his chest as he dives off the mountain. The R rated version shows a different angle with a stuntman falling off the mountain. Additionally the work print shows Delmar's body slamming into the rocks below where as the R rated version cuts away just before. - When Qualen shoots Kristel in the work print all three bloody bullet impacts are shown, in the R rated version it cuts away after the first shot to show Traver's reaction. - The Gabe and Travers fight has been edited (this might not be censorship, apparently the filmmakers decided it would be better to have Gabe shoot Traver's with his piton gun before falling under the ice as per the R rated version) in the work print Gabe shoots Traver's once with the piton gun and Traver's gets up and tries to shoot Gabe through the ice and is then shot by Hal three times with a shotgun before falling under the ice (this explains why Hal appears with a shotgun in the R rated version). - The ending fight with Gabe and Qualen has been shortened so kidney punches, an arm break and a longer shot of a terrified Qualen crashing to his death in the helicopter were taken out.",

This version was shortened by approx. 20 minutes, all actors voices redubbed to make them more American-sounding (most notably that of Abronsius), the music was slightly altered and a cartoon prologue featuring Abronsius & Alfred was added. This was done by producer 'Martin Ransohoff' (qv) without 'Roman Polanski' (qv)'s approval. Other edits included the shortening of the trip to Krolock's castle, the shots of Shagal watching the maid cleaning the floor as he stomps the sauerkraut, and Alfred searching for the mysterious voice in the castle corridors. Ransohoff also tried to have the American version distributed under the title \"The Fearless Vampire Killers: or, Pardon Me But Your Teeth are in my Neck\". Upon seeing this American version, Polanski tried to have his name removed from the credits. The prints that are currently being used have been restored to their original British length of 107 minutes and carry the title of simply \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\".",

The sequence is also slightly trimmed to eliminate some nudity and also remove the shots of Hugh Griffith observing the action. - The original credits are Pythonesque animations by Terry Gilliam. These animations were replaced in the AIP re-edit by stills of some of the winged creatures. - The music score was changed - the new music was composed by Lex Baxter. Wilfred Joseph did the original score. - All topless nudity was removed from the AIP re-edit. This involved trimming several scenes and re-framing others (zooming in on the \"unoffensive\" part of the frame). This chopped about 3m off the running time. - The death of Essay Persson was abridged - In the middle section of the film some other scenes were re-positioned in the narrative with the intent of bringing forward the appearance of the coven (in order to speed up the narrative). The version on DVD runs 91m whereas the old AIP version runs only 87m.",

The 2007 release by Allumination Filmworks has a total running time of 50:03 (including 00:30 of production clips) and was probably shortened for release on commercial television in an hour long time slot. Both DVDs list a running time of \"approximately 60 minutes\". The Allumination version was created by cutting 05:51 out of the Bonneville feature; the longest cut (02:42) begins in the \"Twinkie\" scene when Jess promises May Belle that he will get even with Janice Avery for eating May Belle's Twinkie, continuing through Leslie and Jess forging a letter to Janice from Willard Hughes, through Jess putting the letter in Janice's desk, through Jess seeing puppies being given away for free, through Leslie telling Jess that Janice is in the bathroom crying, and stopping just before Leslie tells Jess why Janice is crying. The shortest of the 13 cuts is 4 seconds. Noticeable cuts include: (after May Belle tells Jess she followed him and Leslie) Jess threatening May Belle (\"I catch you following me and your life ain't worth nothin'.\" and \"I'll tell Billie Jean Edwards you still wet your bed.\"); after Jess enters Miss Edmunds' red sports car and Miss Edmunds says \"I'm so glad your mom let you come today\", Jess' response, \"Oh!

Many of the added or extended sequences involved Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie's characters. With battle of Gaugamela now starts earlier. Taking a cue from classic movie epics, the opening reels now set up the basic themes with greater economy: Alexander's Oedipal relationship with his parents, Olympias' ambitions for her son, the boy's need to surpass his father, and the entirely natural way in which myth/religion is shown as integral to the ancients' behavior. Oliver Stone reworked the third act, juxtaposing events in India and Greece. And Jolie's Olympias emerged more as a genuinely pathetic figure in the whole tragedy. Stone wanting to isolate her character's own ambition from the one person she loves. Ptolemy's final scene was edited. Stone also reworked Alexander's death scene secondary to audience feedback, adding 17 seconds to the scene.",

        "All prints of the original version of \"The Cage\" were destroyed by Paramount sometime in the sixties...or so it was thought. For over two decades, the only surviving copy had been a 16mm black and white proof print personally owned by Gene Roddenberry. Mr. Roddenberry took this proof print with him on the college lecture circuit throughout the 70's and early 80's. As a result of many showings in dilapidated 16mm projectors, it has become badly scratched and damaged. One of the versions available on video is a re-created hybrid of the original, using the B&W proof print as a reference, reconstructed from footage used in the episode \"The Menagerie\" (transferred from the original color camera negatives) and the deleted footage (as originated from the B&W proof print)...this version was originally released on video in the 1980s (and most recently on DVD) with a special introduction by Gene Roddenberry. Then, a few years later, in 1988, a full-color original print of the episode was discovered in the Paramount archives and then released as a filler episode during the original syndication run of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" due to a Hollywood strike (it was later shown during the Sci-Fi Channel's first run of the original \"Star Trek\" series). The original soundtrack to the discovered print was missing, but the re-mixed soundtrack used for the previous hybrid B&W/color version (in which the \"Menagerie\" soundtrack was used wherever possible to avoid using the severely scratched and degraded optical soundtrack from the proof print) was re-synched to this restored full-color version to make it look and sound whole. In any event, the most significant difference in the existing versions of the pilot is the voice of the Keeper. In the numberous restored versions, it switches between that of actor Vic Perrin in the footage taken from \"The Menagerie\" and that of Malachi Throne in the restored footage. This is because, coincidentally, Malachi Throne was cast as Commodore Mendez in \"The Menagerie\". The producers, quite rightly, thought that it would be confusing for Commodore Mendez and The Keeper to have the same voice, so The Keeper's lines were re-dubbed. (All Thelosian characters were played by women with dubbed male voices.) Among the other addtional scenes/differences in the original version-- -Pike discovers a monster lurking in the Talosians' chambers during the Captain's imprisonment; an extended version of Pike's first illusion, set on the planet Rigel VII (referred to earlier in the film by the ship's doctor) -Spock and crew suspect that their weapons are an illusion by the Talosians -extended dialogue by the Keeper about \"Number One\" -an extended illusion scene set in the countryside -an extended version of the Orion Slave Girl sequence -the Enterprise loses power as they are about to escape from Talos, and the computer bank goes out of control (both a result of the Talosians' telepathic powers) -and an extended closing scene aboard the bridge.",

This cut expands scenes, motivates Claire's romantic involvement with Sam Farber and keeps it from seeming less frivolous and more the expression of a wounded heart (in that her ex-lover Eugene cheated on her with the character Makiko, played by Adele Lutz), additional scenes in San Francisco with Allen Garfield as an evil car salesman which is a take-off on his character in another Wenders film) and many other expansions/additions. The full-length version divides the film into three parts, all given special episode names and all with opening credits because it was originally intended for this version to be released as three separate films.

He's dead.\" In the other version, he instead says \"I never met my Dad. He's some kind of mystery\" (which serves as a better setup for information learned later) Also, Tony returns to the band's apartment after his release from the hospital, only to find they have moved out. In both versions, under 'People Are Strange,' we hear him on the phone with a friend, but the phone conversations begin completely differently. In one we never learn what happened to the band, only that they seemed to have moved out and left Tony behind, while in the other we learn that the band has gone on to big things, with a gold album. Both versions' phone calls end the same way, though, with Tony desperately asking his friend for money or drugs.",

Wat and Roland say there should be three phoenixes, since there's three of them. - Lord Adhemar's original introduction scene, where he slaps around one of his servants while having his armor fitted, and reference is made to the \"triple phoenix\" design of Sir Ulrich's crest. - Chaucer giving another substantial introduction for Sir Ulrich, similar to the first one, right before his match with Lord Adhemar. He berates Adhemar's herald before the speech; after the speech, Adhemar's herald appears impressed, which leads to his imitation of Chaucer's style later in the film. - When Adhemar leaves the dance, we find out the reason for his pained expression; in a deleted scene, he reveals to a monk that he is tone-deaf, and has never been able to hear music as anything more than noise. Adhemar then strides out into the midst of the poor, waiting outside the castle for handouts, and starts a riot by throwing food and money into the crowd. - Another deleted scene has Will, Roland, Wat, and Kate seeing Chaucer walking back to their quarters naked again. They follow him, but it turns that he was fetching food for his wife, Phillipa (who is also naked), and had not lost his clothes gambling like they thought. They leave, laughing, and run into Jocelyn and Christiana. Christiana and Roland leave together (with a suggestion of romance), William and Jocelyn leave together, but when Wat holds out his hand for Kate, she just hands him a pastry and walks off. Wat says \"Hey, Beautiful\" to the pastry and walks off happy anyway. - The original version of the scene with William in the stocks is considerably longer, and has an extensive speech by Chaucer (which is probably his best in the film). Rather than having the crowd calmed by the appearance of Prince Edward, the crowd is converted by Chaucer's speech, and has already begun chanting \"William, William!\" by the time the Prince reveals himself. A much stronger version of the scene, but cut down in favor of having the Prince's role expanded.",

It reveals that Grace teaches English to the Na'vi children until a serious incident came about (bullet holes around, etc..) which was insinuated about. - Jake and Neytiri tripping through the neon-light woods is slightly longer. - When Jake joins the circle, a little Na'vi girl smiles at him curiously, but her father holds her back. Neytiri then arrives and hands Jake a fruit. - Jake tries to ask Neytiri her name, but she seems annoyed by that. - Jake, Grace and Norm proceed from the helicopter to the secluded laboratory. There's an explanation about the mountains. - At night, Jake and Neytiri run through the luminescent forest. - After Jake touches the Fan Lizard, it flies away in a radiant glow. Its fellow species follow suit and, to the delight of Jake and Neytiri, raise themselves into the air. - As Jake and the other Na'vi climb the mountain, Neytiri flies past them on a Seze. - The Na'vi goes for an aerial hunt for Stuurmbeast. Jake shoots one and exclaims in excitement. Neytiri follow suit as well. - The Na'vi destroy the Hell Trucks of the mining company. - The next morning, Wainfleet's squad sifts through the remains of the Hell Trucks. Turns out that Na'vi kill the soldiers as well. Quaritch and Selfridge watch the live broadcast. - Tsu'tey's fall from the sky is longer.

He insists Jake to kill him because by Na'vi customs, Jake has to pass him to the Eywa by killing him by his own hands. Neytiri starts to cry. Jake reluctantly complies with his wish, stabbing him by the knife as the camera passes by him. - The end credits has an addition of using Discovery Zone's Bless the Plague soundtrack.

This version has the following scenes reinstated: - A guardsman named Mr. Widdenfield (played by Arthur Malet) harasses Captain Greer, while Mrs. Hobday tries to clear things out (leading into the song \"The Old Home Guard\"). - A Home Guard sergeant asking for permission to dismiss the marching parade (immediately after \"The Old Home Guard\" ends). - Mr. Jelk tells Mrs. Hobday of his plans to buy Miss Price's house. - At dinner time, Carrie tells Miss Price she and her brothers are orphans, while she explains what happened to their caretaker, Aunt Bessie. - Miss Price notes mango-wurzel jam is available at the dinner table, and they say grace, as the children look disgusted at Miss Price's tastes in food. - Miss Price tells the children no one has ever seen her workroom before. - As Mr. Jelk brings a letter to Miss Price (the one that informs her the Emelius Browne Correspondence College of Witchcraft has closed), he tries to get into the house and talk to her, but she politely sends him away. - When Miss Price asks Paul for the bedknob back to get to London, Charlie attempts to extort some money from her, but she rebuffs him. - After \"The Age of Not Believing,\" Paul tries to get the bed to fly, but Miss Price forgot to tell him to tell the knob where to take them. - When the children find Mr. Browne on the streets of London, they take the bed with them and follow him. - The entire song \"With a Flair\" and its lead-in, as well as Mr. Browne's subsequent offer to sell his magic props. - When Miss Price says \"we'd be delighted [to join Mr. Browne for luncheon],\" Mr. Browne asks if the children belong to her. - At the townhouse where Mr. Browne is staying, Miss Price explains to her what substitutiary locomotion is and why she wants the spell. - The second nursery scene, in which Paul discovers the book \"Isle of Naboombu,\" is put before \"Eglantine\", whereas it was formerly after it. - The song \"Eglantine\" is restored to its entirety. - The song \"Portobello Road\" is restored to its entirety, as its subsequent dance sequence. The main song adds a scene with a used clothing merchant and another scene where Charlie and Paul play cricket. In the dance, the Caribbean dance now precedes the Irish dance. Unlike the rest of the formerly cut scenes, the tail end of the Irish dance and the beginning of the dance's climax only existed as a faded work-print that had to be digitally scanned and cleaned before it could be brought back to a passable state. - Mr. Browne tells Swinburne that the bed once belonged to royalty and is being offered to the Bookman as a present, while the children push the bed through the door. - Mr. Browne rebuffs the Bookman's offer to swap sections of the book, but relents when he is threatened. - A scene in the village store where Mrs. Hobday meets Mr. Browne and suggests he should marry Miss Price. Mr. Jelk walks in and overhears them. - The song \"Nobody's Problem's for Me\" is reinstated after Mr. Browne leaves the house. No orchestral track existed, so the studio recorded a new one.",

There are various shots outside depicting the streets of Saigon. - When the two soldiers pick up Willard in the hotel room there is a brief conversation while they help him shower and shave. They notify him that his wait for his new mission is now over. - The scene where Willard is given his assignment is longer and contains much more dialogue. The general informs Willard that the mission is purely voluntary and he can decline it. The general also offers Willard a promotion to major upon completion of the mission. For some reason Colonel Kurtz is referred to in this scene as \"Colonel Leevy\". There are some external shots of the military base. - A brief scene where Willard is introduced to the crew of the Navy P.B.R. - Carmine Coppola's score is not present in this version. Many more songs by The Doors are played throughout the film instead. - None of the narration or dossier voiceovers are in this version. - There is no audio dubbing in this version. All the audio is from the sound recorded during the actual filming. Much of Robert Duvall's dialogue is unitelligable due to the sound of the helicopters in his scenes. - A much longer first cavalry \"Ride of Valkyrie\" attack scene (30+ mins)showing much unused footage and alternate takes. - A much longer playboy bunnies performance. - Various extended scenes on the boat, and alternate takes and shots. - A scene where a miniature toy boat passes the Navy PBR. Lance tries to grab it out of the water. The Chief yells at him to leave it alone claiming it's a booby trap. To prove it the Chief fires some shots at it to which it explodes. - When the P.B.R. reaches Do-lung bridge, the soldier that greets them gives a more detailed explanation of the chaos around the bridge. - When Lance is reading his letters on the boat, he suddenly stops to machine gun a water buffalo on the shore. The Chief yells at him to stop. - The sequence where Clean is killed is omitted. - A slightly longer French plantation sequence. After the French woman strips she crawls into the bed with Willard and they begin kissing. - The sequence where the Chief is killed is omitted. - More dialogue between Willard and the photojournalist when they first reach the Kurtz compound. The Journalist reveals that it was HE who was able to get the montangnards to break off their attack on the boat in the previous scene. Willard repeatedly asks the Journalists name but he refuses to answer. - The character of Colby, (the soldier who was sent before Willard to kill Kurtz, played by Scott Glenn) has a much more substantial role in this version. As Willard inspects the compound, Colby tells Willard that the night before, NVA soldiers had attacked (which explains all the bodies laying about the compound). Willard then enters Kurtz's house, much to the dismay of the journalist. Willard sees Kurtz empty bed and his medals, also his journal with the inscription \"Drop the bomb, exterminate them all\" (many of these scenes were in the final version but re-inserted in different places). - The scene where Willard talks to Chef about the air strike on the boat is omitted. - In this version. The first time Kurtz appears is the scene where a mud caked Willard is tied up (seated) to a pole in the rain. Kurtz appears with camouflage face paint, Willard asks....\"Why he is being mistreated?\" and tries to bluff his way past Kurtz by telling him that he had just completed a secret mission in Cambodia, and only stopped for supplies. Kurtz says nothing to him, but plants Chef's head in his lap. (Only a portion of this scene was in the original version). - The scene where Willard meets Kurtz in his bed chamber contains more dialogue....as Kurtz makes it clear that he knows why Willard is there. - A scene where Kurtz talks to Willard in the bamboo cage while two children sit on top of the cage and dangle insects in Willard's face. He tells him that Willard is \"like his colleagues in Washington, master liars who want to win the war but don't want to appear as immoral or unethical\". - A lengthy scene where the montangnards in a ritualistic display pick up the bamboo cage (with Willard inside) and poke him with sticks (Lance and Colby participate in this). The natives dance around the bamboo cage, chanting and singing while a squealing pig is tied up and killed. - A 10 minute version of the scene where Kurtz reads the poem \"The Hollow Men\", intercutting between his reading and the journalist talking with Willard. - A scene where the journalist meets Willard to tell him that he thinks Kurtz is about to kill him because he took his picture again. During which Colby comes behind the journalist and shoots him three times, killing him. Willard throws a knife at Colby's stomach to which he falls, but before he dies he asks Willard to talk to his family for him and asks him to kill Kurtz. - Kurtz speech about the horror and the children vaccination are omitted. - During the assassination scene at the end, before Willard enters Kurtz' home, one of the guards confronts him. Willard picks up a spear to defend himself as the guard picks up a child to shield himself. Willard runs the spear right through the child and into the guard. The final scene with Willard and the montangnards after Kurtz assasination are omitted.",

They stroll together down the streets. - 2. After the wedding scene, a montage follows of Paul asking people where Becky is. When he finally gets a lead, he finds Becky as a tour guide atop the Space Needle. This one was not used because preview audiences felt Paul took too long in trying to find her. - 3.

        "A longer director's cut, titled \"Apocalypse Now Redux\", debuted on 11 May 2001 at the Cannes film festival. This cut was re-edited by Coppola and Walter Murch and features a new Technicolor dye prints with additional footage originally left out of thetheatrical release. The new version is 197 minutes long (53 minutes longer than the original version). The restored footage also includes the French plantation scenes with Aurore Clement and Christian Marquand, as well as scenes from the crew meeting the Playmates later on. - There are additional scenes when the crew is with Kilgore. During the napalm strike, he helps a wounded Vietnamese child. The napalm strike has ruined the favorable surfing conditions, so Lance and the others leave, much to Kilgore's dismay. Before they leave, Willard steals Kilgore's surfboard. Finally, just before Willard and Chef leave the boat to search for mangoes, a helicopter files by with Kilgore on loudspeaker, asking for his surfboard back. - In the Playmate scenes, Willard trades two drums of oil in exchange for spending two hours with the Bunnies. We see Chef with Miss May in a helicopter, and Lance with the Playmate of the Year in a ransacked house. Miss May was once a bird trainer at Busch Gardens and tries to talk about birds with Chef while he is busy trying to get her to re-enact her photo that he showed the crew. They end up kissing and Miss May gets excited because Chef kisses like a bird. The Playmate of the Year is talking to Lance about her troubles and insecurities about being a Playmate. Clean is seen trying to barge in on both men, and when he barges in on Lance, the Playmates open a chest (in which to hide) and discovers a dead Vietnamese. Lance comforts her. Chef finds out afterwards that Clean is a virgin and starts calling him names on the boat. Willard told Chief that the whole crew can spend time with the Bunnies, but Chief refuses. - At the plantation, Chef figures that they are French first and tells them in French that they are Americans and are friends. They bury Clean with his tape player there, and eat dinner with the French. The crew eats with the staff, and Willard eats with the family. Chef wants to speak to the chef but is informed he only speaks Vietnamese. Willard is lectured about France's colonial history in Indochine as well as their military blunders. There also is a scene with Willard and Roxanne, one of the French women, smoking opium. - At the Kurtz compound, Willard is imprisoned in an oven-like box. Kurtz appears, accompanied by a group of children. He reads to Willard from Time magazine articles about the Vietnam War.",
