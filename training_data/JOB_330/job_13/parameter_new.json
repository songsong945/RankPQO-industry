This is most noticeable in Season 4, where 7 of the 22 episodes have some type of edit. The German region 2 Season 4 set uses non-syndicated versions of these episodes, although the Dutch and French sets have the syndicated versions. The DVD box sets from Season 3 onward do not feature the original \"Love and Marriage\" theme song in the opening sequence. This was done because Sony was unable to obtain the rights to the theme song. It is highly unlikely that the theme song will return in any yet to be released DVD box set. The replaced theme song was the cause of the syndicated versions of seven episodes in Season 4, as Sony falsely claimed did not have access to the original masters of these episodes, and had to use syndicated prints. This is proved wrong since they used the originals from Season 4 in \"Most Outrageous\" DVDs that contained some episodes. As the end credits had to be altered to credit the new theme song, certain scenes that originally ran during the end credits had to be replaced with a freeze frame. In most episodes affected, the original audio plays in the background while you see a freeze frame, however in a few cases a freeze frame is used, but the original audio is replaced with the theme song."

A slightly longer opening sequence on the model's runway where a skinny audience members mumbles \"I both love it and I hate it\" before the first model blimps up. - 2. In the first Tender Loins sequence, there is new footage starting with a conversation with the bartender and Persephone about her new boyfriend, whose brother she is going to meet. The boyfriend shows up and his brother is revealed to be his Siamese twin with an inexplicable British accent and snooty, patrician attitude. The manager then panics because Erotica hasn't shown up for work. This segues into a sequence where Erotica as Stripperella (This is Stripperella's (And Erotica's)first appearance in the two-parter, NOT the reveal of Erotica as she starts her act in the Tender Loins, as it is in the single episode version) rescues a baby from the lion's pit at a zoo. Giving the baby to its mother she is thanked but griped at because she destroyed the baby's heirloom blanket. She then talks to the zoo-keeper about moving the lion's pit to a place farther from the kids play area. She continues to give a lecture about increasing the lion's pit size before looking at her watch and realizing that she is late for work. Then we see a sign on the front of the Tender Loins advertising \"The Best Cervix in Town!\" The original footage picks up here. This whole sequence lasts for about 2 1/2 minutes. - 3. When Stripperella enters Flinderman's en route to FUGG headquarters, new footage has her stop to admire a shoe sale before her navel ring beeper beeps again, causing her to continue running to the secret door to the headquarters. - 4. After another model blimps up at the Stiffy Woods concert video, new footage shows a scene in the Tender Loins as Persephone is talking with her boyfriend. It starts when Persephone eats a Marcino cherry, revealing that she is able to do origami with her tongue when she works the stem and makes a miniature model of the Eiffel Tower. Her boyfriend is impressed, but the snotty Brit wannabe Siamese bother asks her if she learned that trick at \"whore school\". The date continues until the boyfriend chokes. Persephone performs the Heimlich maneuver, explaining that lots of strippers choke when they grab dollar bills with their teeth. The Brit wannabe remarks sarcastically about the anecdote, resulting in an argument. This lasts a little over a minute. - 5. The scene introducing Dr. Cesearean is extended when he makes the joke about seeing Enorma \"in the obituary column!\" The original scene ended when he went back into his office, whereas the new one continues with him laughing maniacally in his office as the the camera pulls out and reveals his waiting room filled with shocked onlookers. This ends with a \"To Be Continued\". - 6. The \"Next on Stripperella\" segment shows footage from Part Two, including a scene showing the Siamese twins fighting each other. - PART ONE runs for about 22 minutes without commercial."

        "When Blind Fury was being prepared for TV in the early 90s, many changes were made to the finished film, adding short extensions here and there, as well as alternate \"TV friendly\" takes of various lines. Here's the full list of changes: 1. Alternate take: Billy sticks his tongue out at Nick to \"test\" his blindness, rather than giving him the finger as in the theatrical cut. 2. Deleted shot: Billy runs outside along his backyard pool, with a tracking shot revealing more of his dinosaur sculptures 3. Extended scene: Lynn mentions Frank not discussing the war, prior to Nick pouring the tea (thus, the \"he never even talked about the war\" line is removed later on). She later further expresses the difficulties of divorce. 4. Extended shot: After the cop at the bus station checks on Nick and Billy, the shot continues well after they leave, with the cop still staring. Due to a deleted scene later, the \"I get the window seat...\" line is removed. 5. Deleted scene: Nick goes to the cashier at the bus station to buy two tickets to Reno, only for the cashier (realizing Nick is blind) to try to trick him by giving him less change. Nick, aware of this, points out the mistake, and also knocks off the cashier's toupee onto a Slurpee. It's at the end of this scene where we actually see Billy say the \"I get the window seat...\" line. 6. Deleted scene: When Nick and Billy first begin their bus trip, it initially begins with Billy using his inhaler, later to use it to wake Nick up. Billy then continually complains that he can't sleep on the bus, with Nick bluntly replying with \"then don't\". This scene takes place prior to Annie visiting Frank, and temporarily replaces the scene with Billy flopping around and hitting Nick on the bus as he sleeps. This latter scene instead is placed after the Annie/Frank scene in the TV cut. 7. Deleted shot: Prior to the bus scene with Nick telling Billy about his father, there's an extra shot of the bus driving into Graceland, complete with a \"Home of Elvis Presley\" sign. 8. Deleted scene: In the middle of Nick's chase after Billy in the cornfield, he actually manages to stop him at one point, with Billy exclaiming the fact that his mother's dead and his father doesn't want him. 9. Extended scene: At the end of the scene with Nick and Billy by the campfire, when Billy attempts to \"see\" what Nick's life is like by closing his eyes, he hears footsteps, only to discover a nearby deer. Nick asks Billy to describe it, and he responds saying it's \"like a real deer... not like in a zoo.\" And that it also looks \"free.\" 10. Extended scene: When Nick and Billy are trapped in the back of Lyle and Tector's van, there's an additional segment in which Billy looks around saying \"It's so dark in here\". Nick, sarcastically, simply replies \"I thought it was just me.\" 11. Alternate take: After Lyle and Tector steal the car from the two old women and shoot out the back window, the TV cut uses a take of Lyle exclaiming \"What the?\" as opposed to the theatrical cut's \"Jesus H. Christ!\" 12. Deleted shot: After the alternate \"What the?\" take, the film cuts back to the two old women, with the unarmed woman saying to the armed one \"You always forget to reload!\" 13. Alternate take: When the driver that Nick nearly runs off the road realizes the Nick is blind, he exclaims \"Holy cow!\" rather than the theatrical cut's \"Holy shit!\" 14. Deleted shot: When Annie sees Nick off to find Frank, she tells him that she thinks Frank was set up by MacReady. 15. Extended scene: After Nick leaves Billy and Annie to find Frank, Annie asks Billy \"What did he say to you?\" Billy says \"To hold down the fort and protect the women.\" Annie responds with \"It's good to know we're in such capable hands Billy. In as deep a voice as he can muster, Billy says \"It's Bill.\" 16. Deleted scene: After Nick escapes from the casino riot to the elevator, there's an additional scene in which he starts eating the food off of the room service tray, as well as dropping his cigar into the coffee pot. 17. Alternate take: When Nick disables the elevator that Lyle and Tector are riding in, rather than the theatrical cut's \"Shit! Fuck! Shit fuck!\", the TV cut uses a far more tame \"Dog! Gone! Dog gone!\" 18. Alternate take: When Nick asks Cobb where Frank is, the theatrical cut has Cobb respond with \"F.O., Errol Flynn. Do you know what that means? Fuck off!\". However, the TV cut dubs in the line \"G.T.H., Errol Flynn.\" in the same two-shot used in the theatrical cut, but uses new footage on the close up on Cobb, with his alternate response of \"Do you know what that means? Go to Hell!\" 19. Deleted scene: After Nick knocks out Cobb and takes the key, the TV cut jumps to an extra short scene in which the Casino guards try to push Lyle into the elevator shaft, only for him to crash back down. Tector then asks \"You okay?\" 20. Extended scene: When Nick and Frank try to find Annie and Billy, there's a long take of Frank asking \"anybody home?\" before searching the inside of the modified bus. This cuts to a longer POV shot of Frank walking through the bus. 21. Deleted shot: After Frank makes the deal on the phone with MacReady, there's an additional shot of Frank exclaiming \"What I wouldn't give!\" and then calming down to say to Nick \"I guess you don't get any second chances, though, do you?\" 22. Alternate take: At the end of the Winterhaven ambush scene, an alternate angle/take of Nick stabbing Cobb is used, in which the bloodied blade and the final stab aren't as prominent as they are in the theatrical cut. 23. Deleted scene: Before Nick and Frank make their way to meet MacReady, Frank steps in saying \"Nick, this way!\" 24. Extended ending: As Billy tries to stop Nick from leaving, the overall scene is longer, with Nick saying that Billy is becoming a man and that he promises that he will call and see him again. This version rarely appears on TV anymore, but was more recently spotted on Reelz Channel."

        "The R2 Special Edition (available on the Alien Quadrology Boxset as well as separately) contains 7 extra minutes of altered and/or extended scenes. As a result, there is a little more character development, but the music has also been re-edited (a bit poorly) in some scenes. Here follows a short description: - The main titles (the distorted shots of the 7 early Ripley clones in the theatrical cut) have been replaced by an alternate opening, which starts with a close-up of a growling alien mouth. As the camera pulls back, it is revealed to be the beak of a fly, that is subsequently squashed by a thumb of a soldier. The soldier uses a straw to blow the fly's blood against a window, which shows that he is actually sitting in a nacell of the Auriga spaceship. The rest of the shot shows the Auriga slowly flying away from camera. - Directly after the chestburster has been surgically removed from Ripley 8, she wakes up from her narcosis, grips the surgeon's arm and breaks it. - In the scene where Ripley is shown drawings of a glove and fruit, directly after Genral Perez, Wren and Gediman leave, the doctor shows Ripley a drawing of a young, blond girl, which seems to trigger an emotional memory in her. - During the meal scene, Ripley repeats Gediman's 'Fiori 16', and he asks her what she remembers. Dr. Wren can also tells some more about the Weyland-Yutani company (\"bought up by Wall-Mart\") - The 'Betty introduction scene has been completely re-edited and extended. The scene now starts with the Betty flying towards the Auriga, Elgyn giving the clearance code over the radio (E-A-T-M-E), but now he flirts some more with Hillard, and warns Call and Vriess over the intercom to get ready. Next, Call and Vriess are shown working on the cargo, followed by some extended dialogue in which Vriess tells Call an obscene joke. This is followed by the scene in which Christie gets his hidden weapons (which came first in the original cut). Next is Johner's 'target practice', Vriess then throws a tool to his head, Call calls him names, but Johner simply replies by asking for his knife. When Vriess comments on his alcoholism, Johner demans his knife back, Call breaks it, Johner threatens her, and there is an extra line from Vriess that he and Cal deserve better company. - During the deal between Elgyn and Perez, Elgyn has some more 'flattering' remarks about Call, thinking Vriess has an eye on her. After Elgyn asks Perez for three days bed and board, Perez agrees under a few conditions (no tresspassing in restricted areas, no trouble, no fighting). - After Purvis shouts \"What's in-f###ing-side me?!?\", Wren answers: \"A parasite! A foreign element!\" After Call says that Purvis can be frozen and operated later, she has another run-in with Johner, followed by Christie agreeing that Purvis comes, but saying he will shoot him if he starts acting funny. - Just before everyone takes a dive through the flooded kitchen, Christie and DiStephano have a short conversation on Christie's weapons ('the disposable kind'), and Call reminds everyone to take a deep breath. - In the chapel, just after Purvis' fake chestburst, there is an extended line from Call, stating she recalibrated ground level, sending the ship into an uninhabited quadrant of Earth, before she mentions time of impact. After Ripley asks if she's the new a##hole model, she replies she couldn't let humanity annihilate itself. Ripley comments that she once tried to save people as well; she remembers a girl that had bad dreams, but she died despite her help, and now she can't even remember her name. After DiStephano enters to take them with him, Ripley asks Call if she dreams, which Call does thanks to neural processors; Ripley says she dreams about the aliens every night, and that she used to be afraid, but not anymore, since it is always worse when she wakes up. - After Johner kissed Vriess for getting them safely through Earth's atmosphere, there is an alternate ending with the Betty landing on Earth. Call warns Ripley for the military that will come looking for her soon. She says someone can get pretty lost on Earth, and asks Ripley what to do. Ripley replies that she doesn't know, since she is a stranger there herself. The camera then goes up, to reveal a post-apocalyptical Paris."

It describes how the passengers did not die in vain: \"The International Ice Patrol now Watches the Seas and a ceaseless radio vigil is in place, etc.\" In earlier versions, these titles are missing. Only the background footage of toys, deck chairs, and other wreckage floating on the water fills the screen.

Sailor Moon did not turn into her own mother, she turned into her future self Neo-Queen Serenity. The English version omits the true nature of the Silver Crystal. To use the full power of the Crystal, the user must want something so badly that they will give up their own life. That is why Tuxedo Mask and the others are upset that Serena (as Neo-Queen Serenity) is going to use the full power of the Crystal. Similarily, Rini/Chibi-Usa risks her own life by using the Crystal from the future. In fact, both girls do use their full power. What really happens in the scene in which Sailor Moon and Rini are floating against the pink hazy background is that the voice of the original Queen Serenity comes to them and says that since the greatest wish each of them had in their hearts was to save the other, they will both be restored to life, through the powers of the present and future Silver Crystals.

This shorter version makes the following changes: - An early scene in which Sada has sex with Ishida while playing a shamisen has been cut by about a minute and a half. In the original version, Sada seemingly goes unconscious and Ishida checks for her heartbeat. - A brief shot (12 seconds) of Ishida and Sada on a bridge has been added to the scene in which the couple goes out walking at night. - A later scene (in which the geishas assault one of their own with a dildo) is cut by 14 seconds to remove a shot of Ishida and Sada's faces in mid-copulation. - An entire two-minute scene is deleted about an hour into the film. This scene features Sada and Ishida having sex behind a thin screen, while Ishida speaks of the \"darkness\" he feels inside Sada. - The scene in which Sada first strangles Ishida is cut by just over one minute. In the short version, the scene ends when Ishida starts coughing and Sada releases his throat. In the original version, Ishida asks her to resume, which she does (only to stop when he begins coughing again). - The scene in which Ishida becomes drowsy while having sex with Sada is edited differently. The original version has slightly different dialogue and has an additional minute of footage where Ishida actually does fall asleep for a short time. - The scene in which Sada wakes up after her final night with Ishida is cut by one minute.

At the time CBS claimed their rejection was due to the use of hallucinogenic drugs in the plot.  While many prefer the anti-Vietnam scenario over the drug theory, several facts support CBS' version. First, they had already broadcast two episodes of entertainment series that were clearly against U.S.  involvement in southeast Asia (\"Route 66\", March 22, 1963; \"Twilight Zone\", Sept.  27, 1963). Secondly, the drugs in \"Harmony\" are quite different from those used in other \"Prisoner\" episodes. On most occasions, they have no more in common with recreational \"junk\" than truth serum as seen in more realistic spy dramas, while the plan here was to take our hero and \"fill him with hallucinotory drugs....dis-orient him\" according to the episode's dialogue. There is actually a third theory that is more likely than either of those.  \"Living In Harmony\" is not identified as a segment of \"The Prisoner\" until the end, unless you recognize star Patrick McGoohan, the parallels to \"Arrival\", and the typeface used in what credits there are (the episode title appears to be the series title).  When the program was first broadcast in the U.K., in some regions (it wasn't shown simultaneously across the country as in the U.S.) superimposed the words \"The Prisoner\" over the image at the beginning.  Star/Executive Producer/Creative driving force Patrick McGoohan reportedly didn't like this at all, but it would have forewarned him to contractually prohibit CBS from doing the same thing. According to this theory, CBS declined to air the episode rather than gamble on the intelligence of their audience."

To fill the running time, elements from the 1981-1982 \"Wake up\" version (none of which were made into PBS versions), and other late episodes, such as Bill Cosby's \"Picture Pages\" segments, and scenes with Kevin Clash's troupe of puppets, making each episode around 28 minutes on PBS.  These versions also featured a new theme song (the much more upbeat \"Here Comes Captain Kangaroo!\" theme replaced the CBS \"Good Morning, Captain\" opening) and opening credit segment,  showing clips from the series rather than the previous, partly animated opening. One of the many hour-long videos released in 1984-1986 (when the show was between homes) was \"Captain Kangaroo and His Friends\".

ABBY: It's all Marty's. - After Marty suggests to the P.I. the \"incinerator\" as a means of destroying the evidence of his proposed murder, the P.I.'s line: \"Sweet Jesus, you're disgusting!\" is deleted. - A couple lines from the landlady showing Abby the studio apartment (mainly assuring her Abby won't be bothered at that location) before she starts yelling at her ex-brother-in-law, are deleted. - As Marty opens his safe to retrieve the bounty money (and swap the photo) his line: \"This is an illicit affair\" has been removed, although he can still be seen mouthing it. - When the P.I. shoots Marty, a couple shots are removed of Marty and the P.I. staring at each other after the gunshot. - When Ray and Abby are discussing \"what happened\", in her studio apartment, and Ray feels cold enough to rise from his seat, the shot of him steadying the walrus piggy-bank is removed and his dialog is heard off-screen to cover this change. - When Abby goes to see Maurice about her concerns, the scene cuts as soon as she enters. In the original version, the scene continues and she is seen inside his place and he pours a drink while assuring her that Marty is not dead, even though she is very worried that he is. Some of the dialog from inside the house is placed over the shot outside Maurice's door before Abby goes in, in the 1998 version. - A new page of credits is added at the end, covering the restoration."

        "In December, 2003, the \"ALIEN QUADRILOGY\" box set was released with a newly created cut of \"Alien 3\" entitled 'the assembly cut.' It attempts to reconstruct David Fincher's workprint (which the studio balked at), but goes one step further and adds color correction, additional special effects and remixed 5.1 sound. Several scenes, however, suffer from poor on-set audio quality, mostly due to the use of fog machines and steam which obscures on-set dialog. Due to time and budget constraints, there was no time to re-record the dialogue for these scenes; optional subtitles transcript the dialog. It should be noted that the October 2010 \"ALIEN ANTHOLOGY\" Bluray boxset features the same 'assembly cut' as the 2003 DVD set. However, this time additional dialogue has been recorded, creating a soundtrack of more consistent quality, and making the addition of the deleted scenes all but seamless. Here are all of the found changes in the 'assembly cut': The scene of Ripley being rescued at the beginning is completely different. She is seen by Clements (Charles Dance) lying wahsed up on the beach and then taken into the prison, covered in dirt. A group of prisoners heads down to the beach with Oxen to get the EEV out of the water. In the theatrical print Ripley is discovered still inside her cryogenic unit inside the escape pod. This scene was re-shot to have footage of the dog (more on that later), and has no Oxen or scenes mentioned above. Various shots of people examining the escape pod that were in the theatrical print (as stated, they were taken from re-shoots made during post-production), including a shot of a facehugger crawling towards the dog and an elaborate optical shot of the EEV being carried out of the water by a crane (in the assembly cut it crashed right next to the shore), are missing from the DVD workprint. Immediately following the rescue sequence, 85 tells everyone in the mess hall to settle down, and Dillon preaches before Andrews' first 'rumor control.' The theatrical version started the scene directly with Andrews' rumor control. Just before the autopsy of Newt, there is a scene with Clemens, Ripley, and Prisoner Kevin walking down the spiral stairs into the morgue where Clemens questions Ripley about her need to certain Newt's death and also asks her if Newt was her daughter. Ripley denies this. As stated above, the alien comes out of an ox instead of a dog. There is a scene where two inmates are dragging an ox named babe after it has suddenly dropped dead into the butchery. They discuss what caused Babe's death, and they have some macho talk about Ripley. The scene ends when one of the inmates discovers a strange dead animal next to the ox's corpse (which is a dead Super facehugger). This scene replaces the scene in the theatrical cut where Murphy finds his wounded dog. The funeral scene is now intercut with scenes of the infant Alien bursting from the dead ox (originally it came out of the dog), concluding with a newly made digital shot of the Alien making its first steps and running off. Just before Ripley enters the mess Hall with her newly shaved head after the funeral, Prisoners Boggs and Rains share their complaints to Dillon about Prisoner Golic. They say he is crazy and smells bad, and that they don't want to work with him in the tunnels. Dillon tells them Golic is their brother and they should stop complaining. The scene in which Ripley and Dillon talk about temptations in the cafeteria ends on a shot of Dillon, where it originally ended on Ripley. Following Murphy's death, there is more dialog between Ripley and Clemens about why they had to cremate the bodies. Right after the scene where Ripley asks Clemens where the Bishop droid is, there is a scene where Dillon sees Boggs, Rains, and Golic, off on their excursion into the tunnels. Dillon asks them to light a candle for the dead prisoner Murphy (the first victim in the vent shaft). They go off into the tunnel. Immediately following this is the scene where Warden Andrews and Clemens meet to discuss Ripley. It has a completely new beginning, where the theatrical version begins with Andrews threatening Clemens, and ends with Andrews telling Clemens to \"sit the hell down.\" There is additional dialog here where Clemens explains to Andrews that Ripley was part of a combat team; Andrews eventually just tells Clemens to get out. Golic kicks open an old cigarette machine in the tunnel to get free cigarette packs. During Ripley's conversation with the reconnected Bishop, there are intercut scenes of a crazed and bloody Golic being found in the mess hall by Eric, the cook, who panics and drops the dishes. A little bit later, Golic is grabbed by the others (Clemens, 85, Andrews, and Dillon) and dragged to the infirmary. The scene following Andrews' talk with Ripley about the alien (where Ripley and Clemens talk) has a new opening shot in which the camera begins with a medium shot of Golic, then tracks through the hospital room. Later on in the scene, a tied up Golic interrupts with a few lines about how in an insane world, an sane man must appear to be insane; Clemens sarcastically thanks him. Golic spies on Ripley and Clemens talking by looking under the curtain. The alien drops from the air vent into the infirmary and lands on the mattress next to him causing it to 'lower'. There are more shots of it approaching, and Ripley sees it's feet through the bottom of the curtains. There is also a shot of the alien opening its mouth before killing Clemens. After the alien kills Clemens, and Ripley runs out of the infirmary, there is a close-up of Golic admiring the alien, he calls it \"magnificent.\" Followed by a shot of a large amount of blood dripping from the grate through which Clemens was hauled by the Alien (just after Ripley takes off for the dining hall). In the mess hall, Dillon leads a prayer and then chastises the prisoners for what has been going on (such as the attempted rape and the death of Murphy, Boggs, and Rains) as Ripley runs down the hallway. Andrews takes over with a sarcastic \"Thank you\" and the scene goes on as originally shown. A new shot where the prisoner mopping up Andrews' blood. He looks up at the air vent (an overhead shot). This is immediately followed by a new scene where Dillon preaches to the prisoners after Andrews' death. In the same scene after Morse says they should take Ripley's head and \"bash it through the fucking wall,\" Ripley replies \"That sounds good to me...\" There are several extra shots in the scene where the inmates set the trap in the tunnel (almost a minute's worth), including one with two inmates checking a pile of batteries, to see if there are some with enough electricity for Aaron's flashlight to work. Ripley looks exhausted while on paintbrush detail and shrugs it off, Dillon shows concern. As the explosions in the corridors are going off, there are several new shots of prisoners in the air vents engulfed in the flames and falling out of the vents on fire, as well as 85 running away from a burning prisoner. Dillon tries to activate the sprinkler to no effect (the sprinkler goes off in the theatrical version, and the scene ends right there). One of the prisoners is hurt badly and Ripley is trying to help him. The prisoner's friend Junior (the guy with the tear tattoo who initially attacks Ripley in the attempted rape scene) looks fearfully at her as she realizes both of them attacked her. The group runs for the spare sprinkler activator. The alien crawls down from the ceiling as the others (including Ripley and Dillon) try to lure it away. Junior is near the Toxic Waste room and sees a chance to trap the alien and runs into the room, causing the alien to run in after him and sacrificing his life. Ripley and Dillon lock the doors and the sounds of the alien killing him are heard outside. Dillon turns on the sprinklers. After finally putting out the fires, there are several new shots in the montage of prisoners walking through the wreckage of the hallways, and a scene where Dillon is leading a prayer for those who sacrificed themselves and died. Ripley and 85 look in from above and begin to discuss religion. 85 says that the company will arrive to kill the trapped alien with smart guns. Ripley asks him what to do if they won't kill it. Immediately following this, there is a scene where Morse is guarding the still bound Golic in the infirmary. Golic asks Morse to untie him, since his involvement in the killing of Boggs and Rains is no longer an issue. Morse reluctantly unties him, and after Golic asks him, tells him where the alien is trapped. Golic knocks him out and hurries out of the room. Next, there is a scene where 85 and Ripley are sending a transmission to the company about the trapped alien and Ripley, testing the company's intentions, requests permission to terminate the alien. The company quickly replies they are not to do anything against the alien, confirming Ripley's suspicions. Golic then arrives at the Toxic waste dump and tells the prisoner guarding the door he must talk to the creature. The prisoner shrugs him off and suddenly Golic slits his throat and opens the door, telling the alien he'll do anything he wants. Golic's screams as the alien attacks and runs away. Ripley then tells Dillon about the company's plans to keep the alien alive, which might jeopardize the entire universe. Dillon says he doesn't care about the rest of the universe. Ripley insists that innocent people will die and Dillon tells him that the world outside does not exist for them. Morse rushes in and tells them he has bad news. The three of them, along with 85 go to the dump where 85 blames Morse for the insane Golic's actions. Some of the latter scene was re-edited to make it follow the explosion sequence in the theatrical cut. A new scene in the assembly hall, after Ripley discovers she carries an Alien: the prisoners are arguing about the course of action to be taken; now that the Alien is free again, there is nothing stopping it from attacking them anywhere in the complex. One of the prisoners lights a match for his cigarette, which reminds all others of the Alien's fear of fire. They all decide to move to the furnace area immediately (which explains why Dillon's following 'peptalk' takes place there). When Ripley and 85 argue about contacting the company there is some extra dialog at the end of the scene. There is some added dialog in the scene where Ripley tells Dillon about the Queen inside of her, mainly about the nature of the Queen and the consequences of its survival. Also, when Ripley fights with Dillon after he refuses to kill her, there is an added line where Dillon says \"Go kill yourself\". During the scene where the remaining prisoners are meeting to discuss Dillon and Ripley's plan to terminate the alien, there are expanded dialog scenes concerning Dillon telling them they have a choice to get even with the creature for its destroying the others. Ripley then questions 85's statements that the rescue team is on its way. Some of the prisoners discuss religion before the tunnel sequence (right after Dillon says they are \"Praying\"). They laugh hysterically, which freaks out David (Pete Postlethwate). This replaces a scene where David is told by another prisoner named Jones what he's supposed to do. Jones leaves and David says to himself, \"This was her idea.\" Following this, there is a shot cut OUT of the assembly cut of 85 waiting for the rescue team. David (Pete Postlethwaite) finds Vincent's body in the tunnel. As the alien rampages through the tunnel, Ripley asks what the prisoners are doing (when two of them guarding the piston run off) and Dillon says \"Improvising\". There is more dialog when Bishop II confronts Ripley as he refers to the malignancy inside her and the great courage she has shown. There is also an added scene where the Asian medic explains the procedure to remove the alien from Ripley. When Bishop II asks Ripley to trust him and she must choose, the scene is more drawn out, and you can see Ripley agonizing more over the decision she must make. When 85 hits Bishop II with the pipe there is an additional moment which Bishop II can be seen in pain and wiping red blood from his face (adding more weight to the statement that he is indeed human and not an android. He shouts \"I'm not a droid!\" After this, Bishop sees one of his crew-members with a camera trying to film Ripley, and he tells the man with the camera, \"No pictures!\" Several shots of Ripley preparing for her jump, as she looks hesitant and nervous. She looks at Bishop and says \"You're crazy\" right before she jumps. Ripley's death scene is a completely alternate take: In the theatrical version, as Ripley falls, the alien queen burst out of her chest, here she simply falls into the lead. Her body can be seen burning up just before it hits the lead."

The 2002 DVD omits this credit & the Walt Disney Pictures Presents credit stays on screen. - The animation in some of the scenes went back through the clean-up animation department a second time, to correct problems such as wavering lines and missing details, which, while not very noticeable during a traditional 35mm showing of the film, would have been discomforting on a much large IMAX screen. Small details, such as the blood in Beast's wound after his fight with the wolves, were also added. - The Beast's \"stutter\" (\"You wan-wanna stay in the tower?\"), a sound editing mistake, was corrected (\"You wanna stay in the tower?\"). - Six minutes of new footage was added between the songs \"Something There\" and \"Beauty and the Beast,\" most of which is made up of a new musical sequence, \"Human Again.\" This song was written by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken for the original version of the film, but cut for continuity purposes. After Alan Menken altered the song to make it work for the Broadway stage version of Beauty and the Beast, the song was worked back into the film. - During the \"Human Again\" song sequence, the household objects clean up the Beast's castle, which necessitated having the background artists go back and digitally re-paint the backgrounds for the castle scenes that followed so that the castle was clean. - The animation for Cogsworth's line to the Beast after Belle is freed (\"Yes-yes-yes, but...why?\") was completely re-done, as the directors never liked how the animation looked in the original version. - New sound effects are added to the shot where Belle and Phillippe leave the castle to find Maurice, which are supposed to suggest that the Beast trashes his room in anguish (and also so that the backgrounds from this point on would not have to be repainted). - The longer credits necessitated the addition of an additional passage of score music, the version of the 'Transformation' theme that was cut out of the original film, to the end of the film."

In this scene, he climbs up a frozen waterfall.  The scene which would have followed this was the one in the theatrical version where Stallone reaches the top of the mountain and runs to the lodge to meet Jessie.  According to Renny Harlin, the scene was cut because it didn't look real enough...the waterfall was a fiberglass wall and the background was optically inserted.  Also, they didn't want Stallone's character to appear invincible and be able to do anything, like in Rambo. - The second deleted scene is called \"King's Leap\" and occurs right after the scene where the bridge which connects the two mountain faces is destroyed. In this scene, Stallone does a running jump between the two mountain faces, and safely lands on the wall of the opposing cliff.  According to Renny Harlin, this was also cut because while climbers actually jump between mountain faces, the jump they had Stallone doing was a little to far to be believable.  They then got around the part of how Gabe & Jessie got around the mountain by having them backtrack and go all the way around.  Some audio was also re-recorded for that after the \"King's Leap\" was cut.. - Portions of both deleted scenes can be seen in the trailer for the movie"

The other ending, however, is far different in that Carl Scott first runs into Ku Feng's character and the two of them fight first. Soon after, Bruce arrives and finds Carl tied to a tree still alive, rather than hanging dead from an overhanging branch. Aside from this, Feng's death is far more graphic showing a pseudo-X-Ray shot of Bruce's index finger buried into Feng's heart. Bruce then pulls his finger out, causing the heart to squirt out blood and then finally finishes off Feng with two fingers stabbing his throat, and Feng spitting out blood. Shortly after Feng falls dead to the ground, Carl runs over to Bruce and says \"Hey man, okay?\". The shot then freeze frames with Bruce and Carl looking off into the horizon with the end of the \"theme\" (Bill Conti's \"The Final Bell\" from Rocky) playing. While unconfirmed, it is likely the upbeat, albeit more violent, ending was used for the limited unrated US release (under the title Kung Fu Avengers) while the downbeat, but cut, ending was used originally for the wide R-rated US release (under the more popular title of Soul Brothers of Kung Fu) as well as the UK release."

Esteban's run in the city to the tavern is shorter, but an additional overhead shot is shown. The scene in which Pedro and Sancho are telling the story about the city of gold is shortened (they don't talk about how the patrons of the bar should invest in their adventure.) There is an additional scene of Esteban looking shocked when the official says \"find him and you'll receive a whole piece of gold.\" There is a scene difference in when Mendoza is waiting for Esteban at the dock, he waits longer, but Esteban's run to meet him is shorter. The ending of Episode 1 is omitted in that Esteban discovers Zia only. The scene in which Mendoza smiles at the discovery that Esteban makes of Zia, and the both looking to see the clouds turn into the winged serpent forshadowing things to come is not there. - Episode 2: The daydreaming scene in which the golden butterflies turns into the city of gold is omitted, as well as the daydreaming scene in which Esteban is seasick and floating above the mayan ruins. - Episode 3: The daydreaming scene of the seamonster eating the ship is omitted. - Episode 4: Has the longest runtime of all the episodes of the series contains many additions, cuts, and an alternate ending. Additions include Extended footage of Mendoza rescuing the children with Esteban grabbing onto him through the bars so he doesn't get sucked out, followed by Dialogue of Gomez on the deck of the ship saying something about Gaspard. Gomez then slides down the deck of the ship and gets into the boat. There is a scene added in which Pedro and Sancho wake up in each others arms on the deck of the Esperanza when Esteban calls to Mendoza about the St. Elmos fire. There is also an extended scene after the shark attack where Pedro and Sancho say something off camera, and goes into an on camera dialogue with Esteban and Zia's dialogue about Esteban's father. - Omitted scene: There is a small scene of the raft sitting still in the sunlight. - Alternate Ending: Once the Island is discovered our heroes merely paddle their way toward the island, seeing shots of the lizards, and shots of the island. The Episode ends right here, and the entire footage in the English/French versions of Mendoza swimming from the sharks is gone. - Some of the scenes from Episode 4 alternate ending and the rescue can be seen in the English/French version Previous and To Follow segments - Episode 5: This starts where the English/French Episode 4 ends at the raft on the island. There is a scene omission of Zia lifting her dress to sit down. This Episode ends right where Tao points the crossbow at Esteban. - Episode 6: Starts in the tree house right where Episode 5 left off, and has a small scene of Mendoza Pedro and Sancho arriving on the raft. From this point forward all Episodes are in Synch with the English/French versions, with very few differences. - Episode 9: Starts with an additional second of footage zoomed in on the Solaris's sail - Episode 27: Has a second of footage containing a lightning bolt omitted at the start of the Episode - Episode 29: In the Japanese version when Esteban Tao and Zia are struck by the Olmec ray, Esteban spins around much slower and the background isn't changed as much. - Closing Credits: There is an additional bit of animation used of the sun and then transitioning to Esteban's face - None of the previous, to follows, or live action documentaries are on the Japanese DVD's"

Disney could not locate any film footage of this number, but they found the audio tracks and still photographs of the number. The restoration team created a still-photo recreation to include as a supplement; it has appeared on most home video versions of the 139-minute cut. Because it was done on tape and because it was decided audiences might find the switch from live action to still photos jarring, it was left out of the film's reconstruction. The \"Film Facts\" supplement of the 30th Anniversary DVD claims it was there, but the BBFC's listing for the film, dated August 11, 1971, lists its running time as 117 minutes, 5 seconds. The song sequence itself is 2 minutes, 30 seconds, making it unlikely that the premiere screening had the song."

It was not officially submitted for UK cinema release until 1991 due to the film's graphic sexual nature and, although this print was fully uncut in terms of sexual footage, it featured an optical edit during the scene with the boy. Instead of removing the scene Ferman cropped off the bottom and far right of the screen, thus allowing the audience to realize the instability of Sada's character while removing the offending shot. The film first received a home video/DVD release in 2000 by Nouveaux and this print retained the optical edit, though the print itself was a shorter version and missed 6 minutes 15 secs of assorted dialogue and footage (the sexual footage remained uncut). The 2009 UK cinema reissue again featured the shorter print though this version cuts out the scene with the misbehaving child completely."
