Lambert tells Ripley, Parker and Brett how the face hugger got on Kane. - Ripley radios down to Parker and Brett to see how they're progressing on the repairs, Parker and Ripley exchange tense words over the radio. - After the face hugger's acid eats through a few floors, the crew returns to the med lab to check up on Kane's condition.  Ripley sees an X-Ray of Kane's chest and asks Ash, \"What is that dark stain on Kane's lung?\"  The rest of the crew starts asking if Kane's going to live, Dallas tells everyone to go back to work. - After Kane's death, the crew gathers around at the meal table to discuss what they're going to do with the escaped alien.  Brett announces the cattle-prod idea and suggests \"catching\" the alien in a net. - Longer version of Brett's death.  This scene had Brett frozen with fear as the alien grabs his head, he yells \"Parker!\" and then blood poors from beneath his cap.  The alien lifts him up into the landing gear and Ripley and Parker come rushing in.  Parker stands where Brett once was and looks up; blood drips on his shirt and then Brett's cattle prod falls to Parker's feet. - Part of a scene that involves Parker, Ripley and Lambert trying to flush the alien out of the air lock.  As they are about to succeed, an alarm is triggered and the alien rushes out of the airlock (getting its tail caught in the closing door, and spilling acid that causes a hull breach).  Parker falls unconciously to the floor, Ripley does the same and Lambert and Ash come to their rescue.  Ripley vocalizes her suspicions about Ash by accusing him of setting the alarm off. - After Dallas's disappearance, Ripley (being suspicious of Ash) asks Lambert if she's ever slept with him. - The build-up to Lambert's death is much longer.  (Watch the alien's shadow on the wall, it walks in, crouches down, then immediately gets up) A scene where we see the alien enter, crouch down and wait until Lambert notices its presence was cut.  When Lambert sees the alien, it uncoils its tail and walks (like a crab) over to Lambert. - After Ripley discovers the remains of Parker and Lambert, she makes another discovery.  Ripley enters the landing gear area of the Nostromo (where Brett got killed) and discovers a cocooned Dallas and Brett mutating into an egg. Dallas pleads, \"Kill me\".  Ripley flames Dallas and the Brett-egg and then runs to set the ship on self-destruct.",

The only line heard is: 'The director's profession is very peculiar...'; whereas the European cut of the movie contains a longer narration, also starting with the same line, but expanding until the last image before fading to credits. The voice-over talks about how the director's profession is to find images, only to discover another image beneath the previous one which is more faithful to the truth, and then another, and another, until you reach the one which equals reality, the one no one will ever see. Both versions are equally powerful in their own right, though it's interesting to note such a minor difference was made in the first place.

They are ambushed by Nazis, who kill the two spies before Cap finishes them all off. Cap then holds the dying female spy in his arms and is reminded of his girlfriend, Bernie, back in the United States. - There is an additional scene which explores the character of the Red Skull more, and it attempts to make him look much more like a tragic figure, haunted by his painful past. In the 1990's, as Steve Rogers is reviewing the deaths of Martin Luther King and John Kennedy and realizing that the Red Skull is to blame, the Red Skull is shown weeping over the piano seen at the end of the film, re-living the visitation of the Italian army storming into his house, shooting his family, and kidnapping him for their experiments.

Butt-head is equally angry with Washington because the urinals don't automatically flush when you run your hand across them. After the rest of their tour bus has finished looking at an encased Declaration of Independence, Beavis sneaks out, breaks the glass and snatches it to use as \"T.P. for his bunghole.\" While Pentagon guards rush to see what happened, Beavis cleans up and exits the stall with a piece of the Declaration, containing John Hancock's signature, stuck to his shoe.",

Beavis & Butt-Head sniff paint thinner, get 'high', and destroy quite a few things in the process. Episode featured one of the three CAUTION messages (to the effect of 'Sniffing paint thinner is stupid if you're not a cartoon'). - The original appearance of Stuart's House and his parents involved the moronic duo being left in the kitchen alone, where they activated the gas flow on the stove and then lit a lighter, blowing the crap out of the kitchen. (Stuart's mom shows up, asking \"Would you boys like some lemonade?\", to which Stuart's dad rants about how \"We don't even have goddamn kitchen!\"). Also featured a warning about how huffing natural gas was bad, not to mention that fire was horrendously dangerous, again, if you weren't animated. - Episode \"Incognito\" fell out of syndication after only a few airings. In it, Earl brought (and used) a pistol with him to class. This was, however, some time before the Columbine incident.",

        "There was a fourth ending shot, but subsequently dropped from the film due to the fact that director Lynn did not like or approve of it. Shots of this ending are included in the movie storybook. It had Wadsworth as the solo killer of the bunch, explaining that he killed everyone out of the need for perfection in the world, that all of life's consistencies were not good enough, and further tells the six 'victims' that he has poisoned the champagne he served and unless they find an antidote in three hours, they'll die. Police show up soon enough and trap Wadsworth, but not for long. He gets away from the chief and leaves, locking all the people in the mansion. But as he steals a police car, he notices a 'smell' (the dog dropping smell from the beginning of the film) and realizes the Doberman from earlier is now in the police car, and it lunges for him. The police car crashes, and Wadsworth is dead. This implies that the others got out okay now that the windows were not guarded by the Doberman any longer.",

They are ambushed by Nazis, who kill the two spies before Cap finishes them all off. Cap then holds the dying female spy in his arms and is reminded of his girlfriend, Bernie, back in the United States. - There is an additional scene which explores the character of the Red Skull more, and it attempts to make him look much more like a tragic figure, haunted by his painful past. In the 1990's, as Steve Rogers is reviewing the deaths of Martin Luther King and John Kennedy and realizing that the Red Skull is to blame, the Red Skull is shown weeping over the piano seen at the end of the film, re-living the visitation of the Italian army storming into his house, shooting his family, and kidnapping him for their experiments.

Instead, the last we see of him is when he's lying on his back in the burning room and we hear the words of his daughter \"everybody dies\". The camera zooms in on the numbers on the outside door, just as they melt from the heat. The next scene is at Mike's funeral where his coffin is lowered into the ground right next to his daughter's; just as the visions 1408 prophesied. Lily is there, being consoled by Mike's agent. As the procession ends, Lily walks to her car and is met by Gerald Olin who is carrying a box. Gerald introduces himself and gives his condolences. He says the box contains some of Mike's belongings still left in the room. He offers it to Lily while also trying to explain, with a sense of hope, that Mike's death of was not in vain and that because of his actions no one else will *ever be able to stay in room 1408. Lily, in too much grief to listen, cuts him off and refuses to accept the box. Gerald returns to his car and opens the box, which contains the nightgown that was sent through the fax machine as well and the burned tape recorder. Gerald plays it and hears the same dialog between Mike and his daughter heard at the end of the theatrical release. As he listens, he sees a young girl in his rear-view mirror waving in his direction. He turns around to look at her and catches a brief vision of Mike Enslin in his back seat, hideously burned. Gerald jumps but the vision quickly disappears. He looks back at the girl who has found her dad that was looking for her. Gerald catches his breath, starting his car and driving off. The final scene goes back to room 1408. We see a specter Mike Enslin staring out the window. The last shot is of him finishing his cigarette and walking towards the door just as he vanishes.",

        "All prints of the original version of \"The Cage\" were destroyed by Paramount sometime in the sixties...or so it was thought. For over two decades, the only surviving copy had been a 16mm black and white proof print personally owned by Gene Roddenberry. Mr. Roddenberry took this proof print with him on the college lecture circuit throughout the 70's and early 80's. As a result of many showings in dilapidated 16mm projectors, it has become badly scratched and damaged. One of the versions available on video is a re-created hybrid of the original, using the B&W proof print as a reference, reconstructed from footage used in the episode \"The Menagerie\" (transferred from the original color camera negatives) and the deleted footage (as originated from the B&W proof print)...this version was originally released on video in the 1980s (and most recently on DVD) with a special introduction by Gene Roddenberry. Then, a few years later, in 1988, a full-color original print of the episode was discovered in the Paramount archives and then released as a filler episode during the original syndication run of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" due to a Hollywood strike (it was later shown during the Sci-Fi Channel's first run of the original \"Star Trek\" series). The original soundtrack to the discovered print was missing, but the re-mixed soundtrack used for the previous hybrid B&W/color version (in which the \"Menagerie\" soundtrack was used wherever possible to avoid using the severely scratched and degraded optical soundtrack from the proof print) was re-synched to this restored full-color version to make it look and sound whole. In any event, the most significant difference in the existing versions of the pilot is the voice of the Keeper. In the numberous restored versions, it switches between that of actor Vic Perrin in the footage taken from \"The Menagerie\" and that of Malachi Throne in the restored footage. This is because, coincidentally, Malachi Throne was cast as Commodore Mendez in \"The Menagerie\". The producers, quite rightly, thought that it would be confusing for Commodore Mendez and The Keeper to have the same voice, so The Keeper's lines were re-dubbed. (All Thelosian characters were played by women with dubbed male voices.) Among the other addtional scenes/differences in the original version-- -Pike discovers a monster lurking in the Talosians' chambers during the Captain's imprisonment; an extended version of Pike's first illusion, set on the planet Rigel VII (referred to earlier in the film by the ship's doctor) -Spock and crew suspect that their weapons are an illusion by the Talosians -extended dialogue by the Keeper about \"Number One\" -an extended illusion scene set in the countryside -an extended version of the Orion Slave Girl sequence -the Enterprise loses power as they are about to escape from Talos, and the computer bank goes out of control (both a result of the Talosians' telepathic powers) -and an extended closing scene aboard the bridge.",

She turns around and sees Shinji talking and smiling with Rei. - After the scene of her phone call with her pseudo-mother, Asuka stands above her draining bath at Misato's apartment and laments over her situation. - Improved animation (you can see the new chairs) when Ritsuko and Misato talks. - Improved animation when Asuka is in NERV\u00a1s bathroom, and then, when she and Rei are in the elevator (this scene can also be found in the movie \"Death\") - The animation quality of Asuka's battle with the Angel is vastly improved and lots of new images added to make it more deep in some places. - When Rei pulls the Spear from Lilith, Lilith grows legs as she did in the film \"Death\".

The following changes were made to the film for this release: - The \"In Association with Silver Screen Partners IV\" credit is replaced with \"The Special Edition Of--\" on the opening title sequence. The 2002 DVD omits this credit & the Walt Disney Pictures Presents credit stays on screen. - The animation in some of the scenes went back through the clean-up animation department a second time, to correct problems such as wavering lines and missing details, which, while not very noticeable during a traditional 35mm showing of the film, would have been discomforting on a much large IMAX screen. Small details, such as the blood in Beast's wound after his fight with the wolves, were also added. - The Beast's \"stutter\" (\"You wan-wanna stay in the tower?\"), a sound editing mistake, was corrected (\"You wanna stay in the tower?\"). - Six minutes of new footage was added between the songs \"Something There\" and \"Beauty and the Beast,\" most of which is made up of a new musical sequence, \"Human Again.\" This song was written by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken for the original version of the film, but cut for continuity purposes. After Alan Menken altered the song to make it work for the Broadway stage version of Beauty and the Beast, the song was worked back into the film. - During the \"Human Again\" song sequence, the household objects clean up the Beast's castle, which necessitated having the background artists go back and digitally re-paint the backgrounds for the castle scenes that followed so that the castle was clean. - The animation for Cogsworth's line to the Beast after Belle is freed (\"Yes-yes-yes, but...why?\") was completely re-done, as the directors never liked how the animation looked in the original version. - New sound effects are added to the shot where Belle and Phillippe leave the castle to find Maurice, which are supposed to suggest that the Beast trashes his room in anguish (and also so that the backgrounds from this point on would not have to be repainted). - The longer credits necessitated the addition of an additional passage of score music, the version of the 'Transformation' theme that was cut out of the original film, to the end of the film.",

The US version uses alternate, less explicit takes of several scenes to tone down the sex content. - The murder of Johnny Boz in the opening scene is more graphic; we see the killer stabbing him in his neck, stabbing him repeatedly in the chest, in the face and we see the icepick passing through his nose. - The scene where Nick almost rapes Beth is severely cut in the US version (we see ripping off her underwear and forcing her over the couch, then there's a cut to the two of them lying in bed). In the uncut version Nick pulls down his pants, penetrates Beth from behind and she has an orgasm. - The scene where Nick and Catherine make love after going to the disco is longer much more explicit in the uncut version (Nick is seen burying his face between her legs). - The death of Nick's partner, Gus, in the elevator is more graphic. The US version omits shots of Gus being repeatedly stabbed in the neck with blood and gore flying at the camera.",

However, Sega, the publisher of the game, thought the scene was a little too risky to release out for the Western audience.

        "A 113 minute 70mm workprint was shown at the some sneak previews in Dallas and Denver in 1982. The film scored extremely poorly from the test audiences, and it was this poor reaction which led to the happy ending and the voice-over narration. In 1989, sound preservationist 'Michael Arick' (qv) came across a 70mm print of Blade Runner in the TODD-AO vaults. Thinking it was the International Cut, Arick purchased the print for Warners, who loaned it out to the Los Angeles Cineplex-Odeon Fairfax Theatre in 1990 for a festival of 70mm prints. It was at this screening that people realized they were watching the Dallas/Denver Workprint. The film was subsequently screened at UCLA's Los Angeles Perspectives Multimedia Festival in 1991. A 35mm reduction of this version was later shown at the NuArt Theatre and the Art Deco Castro Theater in San Francisco in 1991. It was the success of these four screenings that prompted Warner Bros. to look into the possibility of releasing a Director's Cut of the film. The workprint briefly resurfaced again, by accident, for a one-week engagement (1/15 - 1/21) at the Seattle, WA Landmark Egyptian Theater in 1999. However, this print was the one-of-a-kind 70mm blow-up, directly from the Warner Bros. vault. In 2007, the workprint was made available to the public for the first time on disc 5 of the 5-disc Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD/HD-DVD/Blu-ray Disc of the film (which also contains the US theatrical cut, the European cut, the Director's Cut and the Final Cut). The differences between the workprint and the other versions include: - The logo for the Ladd Company is on a white background, not a black background. - The title screen for the film is different, with the words 'BLADE RUNNER' sliding onto the screen accompanied by the sound of knives. - New American Dictionary (2016) definition of a replicant is used in lieu of the opening credit crawl. - The opening shots do not include the close-up and subsequent pull-away from the eye seen in all other cuts, it simply cuts closer and closer to the Tyrell building. Additionally, the shot moving into towards the window is absent, as are two interior wide shots of Holden standing at the window. Throughout the scene, air-traffic control headings can be heard. - After Leon shoots Holden and he crashes through the wall, hitting the table, the shot stays on Holden as fan blades brush his hair and his back smokes from the gunfire. - Deckard's meal at \"The White Dragon\" can be seen being laid on the bar in front of him, rather than merely being heard. Additionally, the shot of Deckard rubbing his chopsticks together is longer. Also, as Gaff speaks to Deckard, the shot remains on Deckard rather than cutting to Gaff, showing Deckard having some difficulty eating his noodles. - As Deckard and Gaff are flying to the police station, in all versions of the film, you can see Gaff speaking to Deckard, but in the Workprint you can actually hear what he says. - During the briefing, the shot of Bryant getting a bottle and pouring two drinks is absent. Also missing is Bryant's line \"I need the old Blade Runner, I need your magic.\" - Bryant says \"two\" replicants were fried running through an electric field instead of one.\" - When looking at the incept tapes, Bryant comments on Leon's ability to work all day and night. - As Gaff and Deckard approach the Tyrell building, there is more air traffic control heard. - When Rachael asks Deckard if she can ask him a personal question, Deckard responds \"Sure. What is it?\" In all other versions of the film, he simply says \"Sure.\" - When Deckard and Gaff inspect Leon's address and the attendant opens the room for them, he mutters \"Kowalski\". - After Chew tells Roy that J.F. Sebastian will take him to Tyrell, the shot where Roy leans forward and says, \"Now, where will we find this J.F. Sebastian?\" is missing. - After Rachael has left Deckard's apartment, and he walks out onto the balcony, there is the sound of a police siren, which is absent in all other cuts. - When Deckard plays the piano in a depressed stupor: a) there is no unicorn vision, b) there is no background music, and c) we hear one or two notes Harrison Ford actually played on the set. - A whirring sound comes from the Esper that is absent in all other versions. - After zooming in on the shot of Roy in the photo, Deckard can be heard to say \"Hello Roy.\" Then, after printing the hardcopy, he says \"Zhora or Pris?\" - When Deckard gives the snake scale to the Cambodian lady, she says \"It will take a moment.\" - Deckard's search for Abdul Hassan lasts longer: we see more of Animoid Row and the back streets of the sector. As Deckard moves away from the Cambodian lady, there is an eighteen second crane shot showing Deckard disappearing into the crowd. - The dialogue heard during the scene with Hassan matches perfectly with the lip movements. - As Deckard nears Taffy Lewis' club, there is a twelve second crane shot showing the geography of the street. - There is a shot of two dancers in hockey masks outside Taffy's bar. - There is a shot of Deckard asking for directions to Taffy Lewis' from a uniformed policeman. - The audio-only introduction of 'Miss Salome' is slightly different. - There is a close-up shot of Deckard examining a sequin from Zhora's costume. - After Zhora attacks Deckard and flees, we see Deckard loosen his tie from his throat. - \"If I Didn't Care\" by the Ink Spots, is in the background when Deckard purchases a bottle of Tsing Tao, instead of \"One More Kiss, Dear.\" - After Rachael shoots Leon, the shot of him falling forward onto Deckard is absent, as is the shot of Rachael lowering the gun and stepping forward. - In Deckard's apartment, there is no \"Love Theme\"; the initial music track merely continues on longer. Also, Rachel plays a different selection on the piano when testing herself, and the shot of her undoing her hair and letting it floor to her shoulders is missing. - Roy says to Tyrell, \"I want more life, father\". - When Roy kills Tyrell, the footage is the same as in the International version, showing Roy's thumbs going into Tyrell's eyes and blood spurting out. Additionally, when Roy turns to Sebastian, he says \"I'm sorry, Sebastian. Come. Come\", as he walks towards him. As Sebastian turns to run, he can be heard whimpering. - Bryant's info to Deckard over the CB about Tyrell's and Sebastian's deaths are heard as we see Deckard driving through the tunnel. When Deckard is parked in his sedan on the street, he is merely preparing to call J.F.'s apartment before the police spinner interrogates him. Also, when the spinner arrives, we hear police sirens. - During the fight between, Pris and Deckard, we see Pris lift him up by the nostrils. - When Deckard shoots Pris, he shoots 3 times instead of 2. - There is the sound of a thunderclap as Roy examines Pris' body. - We actually see Roy break Deckard's fingers, in a split second close up, with a prop-hand. Also, the shot when Deckard pops his fingers back in is taken from a different angle, and Deckard's scream is much quieter than in all other versions of the film. - There are more shots of Roy running through the Bradbury. - When Roy pushes his head through the wall, there is an extra line; \"You're not in pain are you? Are you in pain?\" - There are more shots of Deckard as he climbs to the roof, and also more shots of him as he hangs on to the neighboring building. - The music during the chase is completely different from the music of Vangelis (according to 'Paul Sammon' (qv), the music used is from old soundtracks by 'James Horner' (qv) and 'Jerry Goldsmith' (qv)). - Different, farther-away shots of Roy as Deckard watches him die. Additionally, there is an alternate narration (the only narration in this version): \"I watched him die all night. It was a long, slow thing and he fought it all the way. He never whimpered and he never quit. He took all the time he had as though he loved life very much. Every second of it...even the pain. Then, he was dead.\" - Deckard's movement through his apartment as he searches for Rachael is different, with a wide shot of him scanning the room. The overall scene is approximately 20 seconds shorter than in all other versions - The shot of Deckard telling Rachael to wait before leaving the apartment is missing. - There is no happy ending, the film ends when the elevator doors slam. - There are no end credits, merely exit music for about a minute: the same cue heard as when Gaff takes Deckard to see Bryant at the start of the movie.",

        "Some of the main differences between the 20th Century Fox aka theatrical version and Studio Canal aka unrated version are as follows: - The opening sequence monologue of Toorop is different. The narration in the unrated version matches the cyberpunk tone of the movie and denounces God. - The unrated version follows with a sequence of Toorop waking up in his flat and having breakfast before he sets out to the rainy street, which is where the theatrical version starts. - On the train to Vladivostok the unrated version includes a scene of an encounter with a herdsman's family from whom Toorop tries to buy-off their seats. - In the Vladivostok club all the sequences of Aurora's encounters with the fighter are edited differently. The unrated edition employs more close-ups to establish the connection between them, whereas the theatrical version uses mainly wide shots. - The fight between Toorop and the fighter is also edited differently. The unrated version has more shots of Toorop hitting the fighter to fit better with his not so much of a clear-cut hero image. - The snowmobile chase is different in the two versions. The theatrical version features more spectacular stunt shots and shows Toorop more as an unbeatable action hero. - Before the sequence in the tent where they all enjoy the food, the unrated version features a shot of Toorop shooting a cute rabbit. The theatrical version does not explain where they got the meat. - The unrated version follows the shower scene in the Canadian motel with the scene of the High Priestess undergoing plastic surgery which was included in the theatrical version at the beginning after the group left the monastery (in the unrated version after this scene follows a montage of wide shots of the car cruising the landscape). The unrated edition omits the whole sequence on the Canadian airport. - The sequence of Toorop's memory scanning in the unrated version is much longer, revealing his whole past and his terrorist activities, including 9/11. After the scanning the unrated version includes a dialogue scene with Toorop and Darquandier elaborating on Aurora's babies and the next step of mankind's evolution. The scene concludes with Darquandier's troops informing them about the short arrival of the High Priestess (this part is included in the theatrical version after the death of Gorsky). - The unrated version omits the climatic action sequence with the Hummer chase and also the kitschy happy ending with Toorop and the two babies. The unrated version ends with Toorop's narration after his reunion with Aurora and than follows with a much longer scene in the hospital. This ending is true to the spirit of cyberpunk. - Also many tracking shots in the film are significantly longer in the unrated edition, making it more focused on the society and the world of the future in comparison to the action-oriented theatrical version.",

When Green and Yvette stand at the bottom of the stairs and decide who is to go first, there are a number of scenes showing the other guests looking throughout the house before going back to Yvette and Green, where she says \"Go on! I'll be right behind you!\" This is how it is found in the theatrical version. On the television version, the scene of the two deciding who is to go first and the the \"Go on!\" scene are joined together, making one scene. All of the scenes in between are edited out. Also edited out is a scene of Scarlet and Mustard in the Billiard room, and a shot where Mrs White is in a darkened room saying \"Are you in here? I'm coming\"",

In addition the shot of Belial on top her dead body and Duane's attempts to pull him off her is missing.

In the unrated version, Becky is torn in half and her bloodied upper-torso is tossed back at Jimmy and Ellie. - In the PG-13 version, during Ellie's nightmare, she merely bites Joshua Jackson's character Jake in the neck. The scene then cuts to a quick montage of bizarre images before Ellie wakes up. In the unrated version, after Ellie bites into Jake, she's shown ripping a large chunk of his neck off and then a torrent of blood shoots out of his wound. - In the PG-13 version, after Joanie knocks out Jake she starts looking for Ellie and Jimmy. In the unrated version, she first stops by Kyle's body, digs into the large gash in his stomach with her hands, pulls them out and then licks his blood off her fingers before proceeding to look for Ellie and Jimmy. - In the unrated version, Joanie (in wolf form) is killed when she is shot in the head and her brains slowly ooze onto the floor. - In the PG-13 version, the coroner discovers that Joanie's corpse has changed back into human form when her nude body is shown laying on the floor. In the unrated version, a sheet over her body is pulled back and only her face, complete with a bullet hole in her forehead, is shown. - In the PG-13 version, Jake's death by decapitation occurs off-camera. In the unrated version, Ellie is actually shown stabbing him in the neck with the shovel a couple of times before finally cutting his head off.",

The Cylons then leave, but Helena finds only Lucy's doll because they'd abducted her",

After that a scene has been added where Salieri and Mozart visits Cavalieri in her lodge. Caterina throws some surly remarks about Constanze before she too comes and asks that she and Mozart go home. Mozart walks out on Caterina, and the scene goes to Salieri saying that he knew Mozart \"had had her\". - When Salieri asks \"What was God up to?\", the monologue has been extended, with Salieri speculating that it might be a test by God. - After Salieri admits to have started to hate Mozart, a shot has been inserted of Salieri praying, asking that Mozart be sent to Salzburg. This is immediately followed by the shot of the archbishop telling Leopold that he won't take Mozart back. - After Mozart refuses to submit his work for the royal appointment, a scene has been added showing Wolfgang and Constanze arguing. This establishes that the couple is in need of money. - When Constanze goes to visit Salieri in secret, the scene has been extended, starting with Salieri teaching a student. - The biggest addition comes after Constanze asks if Salieri will help them; instead of just walking out on her, he says says that she must come to his place, alone in the evening, strongly implying they must have sex for him to recommend Mozart's on the committee. - The scene switches to Salieri praying at his clavichord as Constanze arrives. She begins to undress, with Salieri looking shocked. When she is half-nude, Salieri calls in his valet and tells him to escort Constanze out. Humiliated and furious she throws a candelabra after him. Wolfgang finds Constanze crying in bed at home. This explains why Constanze is so eager to throw Salieri out of her home at the end of the movie. - Another large section is added where Salieri implies to the emperor that Mozart has been molesting young female students. This results in someone else getting the royal appointment. Mozart comes to see Salieri, receiving the news. Mozart asks Salieri for a loan, again establishing that he needs money. Salieri recommends Mozart give lessons to a Herr Schlumberg's daughter. The lesson however turns out a major frustration for Mozart, with Herr Schlumberg's dogs howling and causing a ruckus. - A scene has been added where Salieri and Baron Van Swieten discuss Mozart's financial difficulties. This is followed by a shot of a drunken Mozart again visiting Herr Schlumberg, asking if he may give lessons and - when denied - asks for a loan. That request is denied as well.",

After Kohler shows Hessler the colossal war room, Hessler goes outside and inspects his tanks. - 3. After Pritchard tells Kiley he is being transferred to the United States, Kiley and Maj. Wolenski discuss what should be done with Germany after the war. - 4. The most famous missing scene occurs right after the nuns ask Hessler for aid in Ambleve.

        "The series pilot, \"Beauty and the Obese\", was first released as a 1/2-hour single episode and then as a longer 2-part episode with new footage. New stuff includes: - PART ONE -- 1. A slightly longer opening sequence on the model's runway where a skinny audience members mumbles \"I both love it and I hate it\" before the first model blimps up. - 2. In the first Tender Loins sequence, there is new footage starting with a conversation with the bartender and Persephone about her new boyfriend, whose brother she is going to meet. The boyfriend shows up and his brother is revealed to be his Siamese twin with an inexplicable British accent and snooty, patrician attitude. The manager then panics because Erotica hasn't shown up for work. This segues into a sequence where Erotica as Stripperella (This is Stripperella's (And Erotica's)first appearance in the two-parter, NOT the reveal of Erotica as she starts her act in the Tender Loins, as it is in the single episode version) rescues a baby from the lion's pit at a zoo. Giving the baby to its mother she is thanked but griped at because she destroyed the baby's heirloom blanket. She then talks to the zoo-keeper about moving the lion's pit to a place farther from the kids play area. She continues to give a lecture about increasing the lion's pit size before looking at her watch and realizing that she is late for work. Then we see a sign on the front of the Tender Loins advertising \"The Best Cervix in Town!\" The original footage picks up here. This whole sequence lasts for about 2 1/2 minutes. - 3. When Stripperella enters Flinderman's en route to FUGG headquarters, new footage has her stop to admire a shoe sale before her navel ring beeper beeps again, causing her to continue running to the secret door to the headquarters. - 4. After another model blimps up at the Stiffy Woods concert video, new footage shows a scene in the Tender Loins as Persephone is talking with her boyfriend. It starts when Persephone eats a Marcino cherry, revealing that she is able to do origami with her tongue when she works the stem and makes a miniature model of the Eiffel Tower. Her boyfriend is impressed, but the snotty Brit wannabe Siamese bother asks her if she learned that trick at \"whore school\". The date continues until the boyfriend chokes. Persephone performs the Heimlich maneuver, explaining that lots of strippers choke when they grab dollar bills with their teeth. The Brit wannabe remarks sarcastically about the anecdote, resulting in an argument. This lasts a little over a minute. - 5. The scene introducing Dr. Cesearean is extended when he makes the joke about seeing Enorma \"in the obituary column!\" The original scene ended when he went back into his office, whereas the new one continues with him laughing maniacally in his office as the the camera pulls out and reveals his waiting room filled with shocked onlookers. This ends with a \"To Be Continued\". - 6. The \"Next on Stripperella\" segment shows footage from Part Two, including a scene showing the Siamese twins fighting each other. - PART ONE runs for about 22 minutes without commercial.",

(Stuart's mom shows up, asking \"Would you boys like some lemonade?\", to which Stuart's dad rants about how \"We don't even have goddamn kitchen!\").

The restoration team created a still-photo recreation to include as a supplement; it has appeared on most home video versions of the 139-minute cut. Because it was done on tape and because it was decided audiences might find the switch from live action to still photos jarring, it was left out of the film's reconstruction.

Another odd translation is when the girls gang up on Amy for saying that she wants to \"witness\" the contest.  In Japanese, she says that she might learn something from the contest.  The other girls want to know what Amy thinks she needs to learn from a lover's contest - and who she needs to learn it for! Later, when Amara immediately finds Michelle's hand in the first contest event, Ami says (in Japanese) \"I wonder if it's that kind of relationship.\" That's why the girls all look at Ami and Ami looks embarrassed.  In English, Amy makes some sort of neutral comment. In English, one of the girls comments that Michelle and Amara are cousins. The English episode gets really mixed up in that the translators can't seem to decide if it's a \"Friendship Contest\" or a \"Love Contest\".  At the beginning they go to great effort to make it a \"Friendship\" contest, but then the part where Amara is embarrassed to call out Michelle's name doesn't make sense. At the end, when Melvin makes his love confession to Molly, the translators seem to give up on \"Friendship\" and it becomes a \"Love\" contest again. When the couples go to confess their love, one man charges towards the woman yelling something about love being a battle.  She conks him over the head with a giant mallet.

ABBY: It's all Marty's. - After Marty suggests to the P.I. the \"incinerator\" as a means of destroying the evidence of his proposed murder, the P.I.'s line: \"Sweet Jesus, you're disgusting!\" is deleted. - A couple lines from the landlady showing Abby the studio apartment (mainly assuring her Abby won't be bothered at that location) before she starts yelling at her ex-brother-in-law, are deleted. - As Marty opens his safe to retrieve the bounty money (and swap the photo) his line: \"This is an illicit affair\" has been removed, although he can still be seen mouthing it. - When the P.I. shoots Marty, a couple shots are removed of Marty and the P.I. staring at each other after the gunshot. - When Ray and Abby are discussing \"what happened\", in her studio apartment, and Ray feels cold enough to rise from his seat, the shot of him steadying the walrus piggy-bank is removed and his dialog is heard off-screen to cover this change. - When Abby goes to see Maurice about her concerns, the scene cuts as soon as she enters. In the original version, the scene continues and she is seen inside his place and he pours a drink while assuring her that Marty is not dead, even though she is very worried that he is. Some of the dialog from inside the house is placed over the shot outside Maurice's door before Abby goes in, in the 1998 version. - A new page of credits is added at the end, covering the restoration.",
