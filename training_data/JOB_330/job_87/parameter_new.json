Jake shoots one and exclaims in excitement. Neytiri follow suit as well. - The Na'vi destroy the Hell Trucks of the mining company. - The next morning, Wainfleet's squad sifts through the remains of the Hell Trucks. Turns out that Na'vi kill the soldiers as well. Quaritch and Selfridge watch the live broadcast. - Tsu'tey's fall from the sky is longer.

Both shots last the same length of time and use the same take, the amount of blood was simply toned down digitally for the MPAA. Most video versions outside the U.S. use the 'international version' but the shots appear in the supplements on the U.S. DVD (In the featurette titled 'Violence's History', Cronenberg shows the U.S. and international cut scenes side by side and explains the reason why there wasn't a standard 'unrated' version in the U.S. was because the changes were so small).",

        "There is much incorrect and misleading information concerning the various versions of this film. In America, only three versions have been made available publicly (either for video or theatrical release): - The \"uncut, uncensored, and unrated\" cut. This was first released in theaters in February, 1980 with a running time of 156 minutes. When it was released on video, CED and laserdisc in January of 1984, the film was time compressed down to 148 minutes (though the laserdisc mistakenly states on the cover that the film is 143 minutes). This version was released again on video and laserdisc in 1989, still at 148 minutes from time compression. In 1999, it was re-released in theaters and on DVD back at 156 minutes, without time compression. - The first \"R\" rated version. This was first released in October of 1981 after it seemed unlikely that the film could make its money back in an X rated form. This version ran for 105 minutes, featured many alternate angles, and cut many scenes for the purpose of continuity and pacing. This version was released on video, CED, and laserdisc in January of 1981, time compressed to 101 minutes (and with an afterword in which Bob Guccione encourages the viewer to return the R version and purchase the unrated version via the postal service). This version has not been in release in the United States since. - The second \"R\" rated version. This version was released on DVD in 1999, and used no alternate angles; the film was sloppily cut from the aforementioned unrated version. However, because it eliminates many dramatic scenes that the 1981 R-rated version also eliminates, it appears to have been modeled after the previous R-rated version. However, unlike with the 1981 edit, alternate material was not available, so the (uncredited) editor simply repeated several shots to cover up gaps in the film. This caused for enormous lapses in continuity during some of the most graphic scenes (especially in Tiberius's grotto). This version runs 102 minutes.",

It was not officially submitted for UK cinema release until 1991 due to the film's graphic sexual nature and, although this print was fully uncut in terms of sexual footage, it featured an optical edit during the scene with the boy. Instead of removing the scene Ferman cropped off the bottom and far right of the screen, thus allowing the audience to realize the instability of Sada's character while removing the offending shot. The film first received a home video/DVD release in 2000 by Nouveaux and this print retained the optical edit, though the print itself was a shorter version and missed 6 minutes 15 secs of assorted dialogue and footage (the sexual footage remained uncut). The 2009 UK cinema reissue again featured the shorter print though this version cuts out the scene with the misbehaving child completely.",

        "The home video release of this has a huge number of differences to the original TV version. Many of the scenes are shuffled in order and are much re-edited, and of most note is that much of the original dialogue is dubbed with especially recorded alternate versions, with much stronger swearing (including several instances of the \"f\" word) Some elements of the story (generally ones that would continue as threads in the TV series) are completely eliminated. Various differences include: - The opening credits captions are different, running slower. - A different version of the theme tune is played on the opening sequence. - Archangel discussing with the Senator the development of Airwolf (which gives much of the project's background) is much abridged. - Shots of Airwolf's on-board radar and maintanance screens are completely different. - Numerous scenes have different backing scores and sound effects. - A couple of close-ups of the photos in Hawke's cabin are of completely different photos to the original version. - For some reason, (most of) the story behind the paintings adorning the walls in Hawke's cabin is removed. - On the TV version, before Moffet and his crew head off to Libya in Airwolf, they destory a fighter jet over the desert. On the video version, there is a completely different version of the effectivley the same scene, with them destroying three figher jets over the ocean. - Asides from adding much stronger language, the video release also for some reason also changes numerous lines of dialogue. For pure example, when Hawke tells Dominic that he's got a tough mission for the pair of them, Dominic quips \"What're we gonna do, kidnap Kadaffi?\"; the TV version's \"Nothing that simple\" becomes \"No, a helicopter\". There's numerous other instances of lines of dialogue being changed. - The closing credits are (slightly) different. - The whole chunk of story of where Hawke and Dominic find a hiding place for Airwolf for after they retreive it (in a hollow mountain) and the whole last few minutes after Hawke's recovered & hidden Airwolf, and saying he'll only return it if the Firm find solid information on his missing brother, are completely gone. - The video version finishes (rather abruptly) with Hawke and Dominic having defeated Moffet, flying off over the ocean into the sun-set (in a piece of footage used on the TV episode 'Mad Over Miami') and the film finishing; as opposed to the TV version which has several more minutes with Hawke and Archangel discussing the return of Airwolf on condition that Hawke's brother is found, then Hawke going back out to the lake to play his cello. - Interestingly, there is a scene where twisted creator Dr. Moffet is torturing the kidnapped Gabrielle in the desert, that was in the original TV version but not on this release. This scene is quite strong and as a result is often edited out by many TV showings; considering the stronger nature of the video version, it's surprising it was not included. As this scene is not on the video release and is often cut out on TV, it could be considered to be quite rare",

This version is available as a bootleg. A full list of scenes cut are: - The scene where they are in the shop in the beginning is removed from the \"uncut\" version and is replaced with an extended scene of them driving the truck through the woods. Then they stop when Burt says he left something back at the store and they have a longer conversation about the map. - The scene of Rider Strong going behind the building to wash his hands after Dennis's bite and he pets the stray dogs is removed from the \"uncut\" version. - A different angle of Jordan Ladd's character Karen swimming away after the \"kiss\" scene on the dock with Rider Strong. - When it is discovered that Karen has the disease during an intimate scene, there is an additional scene that follows the \"Don't...Leave...Me!\" where Burt comes into the room and yells at her about how the truck isn't ready yet, and they have to finish cleaning up the bum's blood. - An extended scene of everyone arguing around the fireplace when Burt makes a joke about his burnt marshmallow. - A scene of Burt sitting outside guarding the shed with his shot gun. This immediatly follows when they hear the dog trying to get Karen in the shed and they shoot a bullet and tell Karen that they will stay outside with her to keep the dog away. - The gunshot to Burt's head in the cabin is bloodier. In the \"R\" rated version it cuts away quick and only shows the aftermath from a difficult-to-see angle. - An additional scene where Rider Strong grabs the long-haired hick after the attack and drags him down to the celler. He yells at the hick as he throws him down there and says \"When they get here, tell them I didn't do it!\", then slams the door. - The human-bonfire scene when they say \"We got another one in the basement\" immediatly goes to a shot of the celler door opening from the inside, then a bunch of shotguns appear and start shooting like crazy. We see blood all over the walls. Then they pour gasoline and one cop lights a match and celler goes up in flames followed by more shots of blood and guts on the walls, ceiling, and floor. - The end is switched around a little. Instead of just the cops drinking the contaminated lemonade followed by a country song with the townspeople, the whole entie town shows up and has a cup. There is additional dialoug amoung the townspeople, different shots, and it shows the FDA man walking around more testing and the Water supply truck is in view longer. - That is every scene that is changed or cut from the Lions Gate release.",

There are various shots outside depicting the streets of Saigon. - When the two soldiers pick up Willard in the hotel room there is a brief conversation while they help him shower and shave. They notify him that his wait for his new mission is now over. - The scene where Willard is given his assignment is longer and contains much more dialogue. The general informs Willard that the mission is purely voluntary and he can decline it. The general also offers Willard a promotion to major upon completion of the mission. For some reason Colonel Kurtz is referred to in this scene as \"Colonel Leevy\". There are some external shots of the military base. - A brief scene where Willard is introduced to the crew of the Navy P.B.R. - Carmine Coppola's score is not present in this version. Many more songs by The Doors are played throughout the film instead. - None of the narration or dossier voiceovers are in this version. - There is no audio dubbing in this version. All the audio is from the sound recorded during the actual filming. Much of Robert Duvall's dialogue is unitelligable due to the sound of the helicopters in his scenes. - A much longer first cavalry \"Ride of Valkyrie\" attack scene (30+ mins)showing much unused footage and alternate takes. - A much longer playboy bunnies performance. - Various extended scenes on the boat, and alternate takes and shots. - A scene where a miniature toy boat passes the Navy PBR. Lance tries to grab it out of the water. The Chief yells at him to leave it alone claiming it's a booby trap. To prove it the Chief fires some shots at it to which it explodes. - When the P.B.R. reaches Do-lung bridge, the soldier that greets them gives a more detailed explanation of the chaos around the bridge. - When Lance is reading his letters on the boat, he suddenly stops to machine gun a water buffalo on the shore. The Chief yells at him to stop. - The sequence where Clean is killed is omitted. - A slightly longer French plantation sequence. After the French woman strips she crawls into the bed with Willard and they begin kissing. - The sequence where the Chief is killed is omitted. - More dialogue between Willard and the photojournalist when they first reach the Kurtz compound. The Journalist reveals that it was HE who was able to get the montangnards to break off their attack on the boat in the previous scene. Willard repeatedly asks the Journalists name but he refuses to answer. - The character of Colby, (the soldier who was sent before Willard to kill Kurtz, played by Scott Glenn) has a much more substantial role in this version. As Willard inspects the compound, Colby tells Willard that the night before, NVA soldiers had attacked (which explains all the bodies laying about the compound). Willard then enters Kurtz's house, much to the dismay of the journalist. Willard sees Kurtz empty bed and his medals, also his journal with the inscription \"Drop the bomb, exterminate them all\" (many of these scenes were in the final version but re-inserted in different places). - The scene where Willard talks to Chef about the air strike on the boat is omitted. - In this version. The first time Kurtz appears is the scene where a mud caked Willard is tied up (seated) to a pole in the rain. Kurtz appears with camouflage face paint, Willard asks....\"Why he is being mistreated?\" and tries to bluff his way past Kurtz by telling him that he had just completed a secret mission in Cambodia, and only stopped for supplies. Kurtz says nothing to him, but plants Chef's head in his lap. (Only a portion of this scene was in the original version). - The scene where Willard meets Kurtz in his bed chamber contains more dialogue....as Kurtz makes it clear that he knows why Willard is there. - A scene where Kurtz talks to Willard in the bamboo cage while two children sit on top of the cage and dangle insects in Willard's face. He tells him that Willard is \"like his colleagues in Washington, master liars who want to win the war but don't want to appear as immoral or unethical\". - A lengthy scene where the montangnards in a ritualistic display pick up the bamboo cage (with Willard inside) and poke him with sticks (Lance and Colby participate in this). The natives dance around the bamboo cage, chanting and singing while a squealing pig is tied up and killed. - A 10 minute version of the scene where Kurtz reads the poem \"The Hollow Men\", intercutting between his reading and the journalist talking with Willard. - A scene where the journalist meets Willard to tell him that he thinks Kurtz is about to kill him because he took his picture again. During which Colby comes behind the journalist and shoots him three times, killing him. Willard throws a knife at Colby's stomach to which he falls, but before he dies he asks Willard to talk to his family for him and asks him to kill Kurtz. - Kurtz speech about the horror and the children vaccination are omitted. - During the assassination scene at the end, before Willard enters Kurtz' home, one of the guards confronts him. Willard picks up a spear to defend himself as the guard picks up a child to shield himself. Willard runs the spear right through the child and into the guard. The final scene with Willard and the montangnards after Kurtz assasination are omitted.",

We simply see Monty writing a letter to his parents, mentioning that \"Harold is as intense as ever\" (cut to the cricket scene, maybe 30 seconds long), and then continues with \"I remember our first day... we shared a taxi together\" (cut to the two students unloading their stuff from the car). This alternate version also have slightly different end credits, and does not mention Harold marrying Sybil. The differences are minor (the U.S. version provides a more shocking memento of WWI, when it shows crippled baggage handlers in the station); one of the reasons the cricket scene was dropped in favour  of the station one was due to the distributor's worry that the American  market would not understand it.",

        "The PlayStation and Saturn versions released outside of Japan (including the Director's Cut edition, which was erronously marketed as being uncensored by Capcom's US division) of the game had three of the game's FMV sequences altered from the original Japanese release. Most notable of all is the live-action opening intro, in which shots of corpses during Chris' narration is replaced by newspaper pages, the decapitated hand found by Joseph is only shown briefly and Joseph's death scene (in which he fights shoots a zombie dog in the eye before being mutilated) was shortened. In addition, Chris was originally shown lighting a cigarette during the cast's introduction (this was replaced by superimposed colored footage of early shots of Chris from the intro). The second FMV movie altered was with the encounter with the first Zombie, in which showed Kenneth's half-eaten head is drop into the floor before the zombie himself faces the player. The third and final FMV that was change was Chris' \"bad\" ending, which was reshot so that Chris is no longer shown smoking (SCEA reportedly forbids any \"glorification\" of tobacco use in their games, despite the fact that SCEI has no problem with them). Virgin's PC port is the only version in the US to contain all the FMV intact with the opening intro being shown in color (the original Japanese was in black & white).",

        "SPOILER: The original British Thorn EMI VHS release, when compared to the 2005 Mosaic DVD appears to have many scenes that were not merely edited for censorship but were different takes used in a 'tamer' version. Most obvious is the scene where Patsy introduces Sally to the gang as a potential prostitute. In the original Thorn EMI release she remains fully clothed throughout and when Fallon is asked if he wants to 'check out this piece of merchandise' him and Sally simply walk off screen. In the 2005 DVD Sally undresses in front of the gang at Patsy's insistence and is naked when Fallon approaches her. Another scene that was a different take is when Norris kills Fallon in the woodwork lab. In the Thorn EMI release he simply pushes Fallon back over the saw blade killing him almost instantly. In the 2005 DVD he cuts off Fallon's right arm first, Fallon then staggers upright and THEN Norris pushes him back on the blade. Other scenes cut completely and now reinstated are: - The entire fight with Joo Joo's gang. - The rape scene - Barnyard, Patsy and Drugstore finding Fallon's body - Drugstore's death scene (more close ups of his body) - Norris hitting Barnyard more times on the head with the pipe. - Stegman cutting Diane's breasts before fighting Norris. Also the 2005 DVD has written prologue and epilogue. The prologue states the amount of attacks on staff in US High Schools and states that 'no high school is as bad as Lincoln High....yet'. The epilogue states that 'Andy Norris was never prosecuted as the police couldn't find anyone who actually saw it.",

The musical score is the original Vladimir Kraus-Rajteric score which kicks in very rarely. The scenes are rearranged so that Welles makes his speech to the troops near the beginning and the air attack hits Bihac simultaneously with the land battle. Almost every dialog scene is lengthened and cut slower than the English version, but there are some parts of the action scenes cut a lot tighter. For instance, this is missing the scene where Riva falls out of the truck during the Italian retreat. It is also missing the scene in the Orthodox church prior the Welles addressing the Chetniks. However, it does feature several new scenes, most notably a scene where Vasco raids a house in Prosor only to then shoot and wound his own commander, and then a second battle between the Partisans and the Italians. In this scene, Riva refuses to fire at his own men and Novak almost shoots him only for Martin to intervene. General Morelli is captured and then promptly commits suicide with a pistol. There is also a new scene where the partisans surprise attack a group of Chetniks guarding the Neretva bridge. There are several more violent shots missing from other prints - such as the Ustashans hanging an old woman and laughing when they march through Bihac. There are several more deaths during the end battle with the Chetniks such as a partisan being shot in the back when reaching for a grenade. Then at the end of the battle there is a scene where a partisan named 'Stipe' goes crazy and guns down a number of Chetnik prisoners, only to have his rank stripped from him. Curiously almost all the nationalities speak their own language; with Riva speaking Italian even with his Yugoslavian captors and Morelli speaking in German when addressing General Lohring.

After receiving that advice, the company chose to make cuts to the film for release in the UK and as a result the UK cinema version differs from the US cinema version. The changes occur in two scenes: - in the fight between Elektra and Bullseye the UK version lacks all sight of a dagger sticking through Elektra's hand and all sight of her removing the dagger from her hand. - Secondly, in the fight between Daredevil and Kingpin the UK version lacks a headbutt and has the sound of breaking bones partially obscured by a crack of thunder. For the home video release, 20th Century Fox submitted the uncut version and the BBFC passed it with no cuts. Therefore, home video/DVD releases in the UK are uncut.",

        "Wicked Lady says that she will destroy Tuxedo Mask, but she actually attacks Sailor Moon. Tuxedo Mask throws himself in the way to protect Sailor Moon and Wicked Lady is shocked. She asks why Sailor Moon protected Tuxedo Mask when really it was the other way around. Later, Sailor Venus says \"Sailor Moon turned into Queen Serenity\". Sailor Moon did not turn into her own mother, she turned into her future self Neo-Queen Serenity. The English version omits the true nature of the Silver Crystal. To use the full power of the Crystal, the user must want something so badly that they will give up their own life. That is why Tuxedo Mask and the others are upset that Serena (as Neo-Queen Serenity) is going to use the full power of the Crystal. Similarily, Rini/Chibi-Usa risks her own life by using the Crystal from the future. In fact, both girls do use their full power. What really happens in the scene in which Sailor Moon and Rini are floating against the pink hazy background is that the voice of the original Queen Serenity comes to them and says that since the greatest wish each of them had in their hearts was to save the other, they will both be restored to life, through the powers of the present and future Silver Crystals. In the original, Usagi and Chibi-Usa did not cry when they were saying goodbye to each other in the park. Rini is actually smiling.",

Bennett's death was also trimmed to remove focus on his suffering. The 2001 UK DVD release retained these cuts and also added a further 44 seconds of distributor cuts.

In this version additional edits include: - In the opening scene, after Cooke ('Bill Duke (I)' (qv)) has initially shot the man in the robe, he walks over to the body and shoots him again. This second hit has been removed. - When Matrix breaks Henriques' ('Charles Meshack' (qv)) neck on the plane, he simply elbows him, and in the next shot, Henrqiues is already dead.

The second FMV movie altered was with the encounter with the first Zombie, in which showed Kenneth's half-eaten head is drop into the floor before the zombie himself faces the player.

A slightly longer opening sequence on the model's runway where a skinny audience members mumbles \"I both love it and I hate it\" before the first model blimps up. - 2. In the first Tender Loins sequence, there is new footage starting with a conversation with the bartender and Persephone about her new boyfriend, whose brother she is going to meet. The boyfriend shows up and his brother is revealed to be his Siamese twin with an inexplicable British accent and snooty, patrician attitude. The manager then panics because Erotica hasn't shown up for work. This segues into a sequence where Erotica as Stripperella (This is Stripperella's (And Erotica's)first appearance in the two-parter, NOT the reveal of Erotica as she starts her act in the Tender Loins, as it is in the single episode version) rescues a baby from the lion's pit at a zoo. Giving the baby to its mother she is thanked but griped at because she destroyed the baby's heirloom blanket. She then talks to the zoo-keeper about moving the lion's pit to a place farther from the kids play area. She continues to give a lecture about increasing the lion's pit size before looking at her watch and realizing that she is late for work. Then we see a sign on the front of the Tender Loins advertising \"The Best Cervix in Town!\" The original footage picks up here. This whole sequence lasts for about 2 1/2 minutes. - 3. When Stripperella enters Flinderman's en route to FUGG headquarters, new footage has her stop to admire a shoe sale before her navel ring beeper beeps again, causing her to continue running to the secret door to the headquarters. - 4. After another model blimps up at the Stiffy Woods concert video, new footage shows a scene in the Tender Loins as Persephone is talking with her boyfriend. It starts when Persephone eats a Marcino cherry, revealing that she is able to do origami with her tongue when she works the stem and makes a miniature model of the Eiffel Tower. Her boyfriend is impressed, but the snotty Brit wannabe Siamese bother asks her if she learned that trick at \"whore school\". The date continues until the boyfriend chokes. Persephone performs the Heimlich maneuver, explaining that lots of strippers choke when they grab dollar bills with their teeth. The Brit wannabe remarks sarcastically about the anecdote, resulting in an argument. This lasts a little over a minute. - 5. The scene introducing Dr. Cesearean is extended when he makes the joke about seeing Enorma \"in the obituary column!\" The original scene ended when he went back into his office, whereas the new one continues with him laughing maniacally in his office as the the camera pulls out and reveals his waiting room filled with shocked onlookers. This ends with a \"To Be Continued\". - 6. The \"Next on Stripperella\" segment shows footage from Part Two, including a scene showing the Siamese twins fighting each other. - PART ONE runs for about 22 minutes without commercial.",
