Upon its DVD release over a decade later, the BBC wanted all the DVDs to have the same BBFC 12 rating, but BBFC regulations meant the episode couldn't be resubmitted and reissued in its present form. As a result, the DVD producers tacked a ten second Starbug model shot onto the end of the credits, and submitted this as a \"new\" version, which received a 12 rating, and released this version on DVD.",

The 2003 release by Bonneville Worldwide Entertainment has a total running time of 57:31 (including 02:21 of production clips) and is the original version broadcast on the PBS series \"Wonderworks\", including the Wonderworks opening and closing production clips. The 2007 release by Allumination Filmworks has a total running time of 50:03 (including 00:30 of production clips) and was probably shortened for release on commercial television in an hour long time slot. Both DVDs list a running time of \"approximately 60 minutes\". The Allumination version was created by cutting 05:51 out of the Bonneville feature; the longest cut (02:42) begins in the \"Twinkie\" scene when Jess promises May Belle that he will get even with Janice Avery for eating May Belle's Twinkie, continuing through Leslie and Jess forging a letter to Janice from Willard Hughes, through Jess putting the letter in Janice's desk, through Jess seeing puppies being given away for free, through Leslie telling Jess that Janice is in the bathroom crying, and stopping just before Leslie tells Jess why Janice is crying. The shortest of the 13 cuts is 4 seconds. Noticeable cuts include: (after May Belle tells Jess she followed him and Leslie) Jess threatening May Belle (\"I catch you following me and your life ain't worth nothin'.\" and \"I'll tell Billie Jean Edwards you still wet your bed.\"); after Jess enters Miss Edmunds' red sports car and Miss Edmunds says \"I'm so glad your mom let you come today\", Jess' response, \"Oh! I forgot to call ... oh, never mind\"; Jess and Miss Edmunds looking at abstract paintings in the art museum; (while Jess is at the museum with Miss Edmunds) Bill telling Leslie they could go to town for dinner and a show in the evening; (after Mr. Aarons catches Jess in his arms) the exchange [Jess] \"I hate her. I hate her. I wish I'd never seen her in my whole life.\" [Mr. Aarons] It's not your fault. [Jess] \"It's all my fault. I was supposed to meet her and I didn't. It wouldn't have happened, Leslie would still be ... [Mr. Aarons] \"Hey, Jess -- you can't blame yourself. It's not your fault. [Jess] But I hurt so bad inside, Daddy.\" [Mr. Aarons] \"I know -- I hurt too.\"; (later) [Jess] \"I didn't mean that about hating her.\" [Mr. Aarons] \"I know you didn't, Son.\"; and (after May Belle says \"Boys ain't supposed to cry, are they Mommy?\") [Mrs. Aarons] \"Shut up, both of you, and get out now.

Usagi can't believe it but Minako points that it could be just like Haruka and Michiru. Then Mako (Lita) wonders if the girl might really be a man dressed as a woman! Raye agrees to help Maya with her problem, but in Japanese it's actually the reverse - Maya agrees to help Raye by performing at the festival. Later, Raye talks about how she is helping Maya overcome her nerves. In Japanese, Rei talks about how hard Maya works and begins to feel some despair about how hard one needs to work to be successful. In the end, she and Serena agree to just do their best.

The film was formally resubmitted to the Classification Board in 1989, who re-affirmed the ban. An appeal saw the film's ban lifted and an R18+ rating issued. This version was released on the CBS/Fox home video label. This home video version's opening credits, and the climax featuring Z-Man shooting a woman in her bed, were re-edited. Thus, this version was not uncut. However, the DVD version issued by 20th Century Fox Australia, in October 2003, is complete and uncut.",

(1:24) - We see Douzi being carried atop the servant's back to Old Man Zhang's quarters (0:09) - During the \"deflowering scene\" with Old Man Zhang, after the woman leaves, until Zhang says \"Come here.\" Douzi urinates into a vase, as the old man looks on, getting quite excited. (0:21) - After Cheng and Duan are accosted by rioting students, after the photo session. They are being carted through the streets on handcarts. Na Kun is following, on foot. They discuss first the student revolutionaries, and then the incident at Old Man Zhang's house, which is now a coffin shop. Dieyi mentions that he was there the day before; Na conjectures that he was probably looking for the sword. (0:51) - After Cheng and Duan meet Yuan Shiqing for the first time, and Cheng is presented with jewelry. Brief dialogue as Yuan and then Duan leave the room. (0:19) - After Cheng and Duan argue in the makeup room, right before Juxian leaves the House of Blossoms. Juxian watches a performance of \"Farewell\". (0:55) - After Cheng and Duan argue during the \"engagement\" scene, right before Cheng tucks the baby Xiao Si into bed. Yuan presents Cheng with an elaborate pheasant headdress in his dressing room. (0:51) - After Japan's march into Beijing, right before Duan gets into a fight with the Japanese. Another opera scene, dealing with drink. Also one line of dialogue as Juxian applies Duan's makeup. (1:31) - Scene of Cheng singing to Japanese continues, right before Duan is released. Interior shots, Cheng holding a fan. Music, and applause. (0:47) - More graphic detail in the bloodletting scene. - Brief shot of Duan caressing Juxian's cheek, right after Cheng and Yuan makeup scene. - After our first glance of Cheng smoking opium, right before Cheng and Duan visit their old teacher. Cheng steps out of his home, smoking and looking quite listless. He chokes as a car passes. Then we see Juxian showing a group of Duan's friends to the exit of their home, recovering money that her husband has lent them. Juxian complains that Duan doesn't have a real job; Duan responds that all he can do is sing, and Juxian has forbidden that. Juxian mentions that Duan and Cheng's old teacher wants to see them; Duan says that he is too ashamed to face him. (2:02) - After Juxian visits Cheng in his cell, just before trial. Beginning of the trial dialogue cut, where Peking Opera is described as \"pornographic music\", and the formal charges of collusion with the Japanese Officer, Aoki, are described. (0:43) - Later, in the same trial scene, after Na's \"testimony\", Yuan objects to the idea of Peking Opera as \"pornographic music\".  (1:01) - After the communists march into Beijing, Cheng and Duan are performing \"Farewell\" to an audience of communist troops. The troops do not respond, and then break into a patriotic song afterwards. Xiao Si seems to take to their philosophy. This scene cuts into what seems to be one large crowd scene in the U.S. release -- everything depicting Xiao Si (the foundling) skipping through the streets of Beijing comes after this scene. (1:52) - After Juxian's suicide, and before we cut to the present day, we get a short scene where the traitorous Xiao Si seems to get his due. He is sitting alone with the case of jewelry given Cheng by Yuan, and singing from \"Farewell\". Behind him, communist troops begin to file in, and Xiao Si is startled to see them in the mirror. One of them approaches and hands him what seems to be some sort of summons. (1:11)",

Luigi was dubbed with a slight Modena accent (the home town of Ferrari) and Guido was dubbed with a thick Modenese dialect. The Ferrari in the end of the movie has been dubbed by Michael Schumacher as in the original version (but of course in Italian, with some German accent). 'Giancarlo Fisichella' (qv) makes a cameo. A nice coincidence: 'Marco Della Noce' (qv), who dubs Luigi, is an Italian comedian whose trademark act (several years before the release of _Cars (2006)_ (qv)) was playing of the head mechanic of Ferrari, and includes some of the lines from this routine in the dubbing.",

Seeing two doorman holding open the doors for customers, Bean seizes the opportunity and simply drives through the doors, around the inside of the store and then out the other side to get through the jam. - Bean pulling up to a 'No Parking' sign at his place of work, getting out a pair of false legs, pushing them underneath the car, and dropping some wrenches next to the legs to simulate his making repairs. - Bean hearing the news that he'll be going to America. He thinks that everyone will be carrying a gun so he makes believe he's holding a gun with his hands, and mimics Eastwood-like moves and even says to a man, \"Are you feeling lucky punk?\" - Bean reprising the 'head in the lap' gag in which he is wearing a blindfold to help him sleep while on the plane to America. He starts to fall down in his seat and then manages to have his head fall into the crotch of the passenger sitting next to him. The passenger yells for a stewardess to switch him to a different seat and Bean tries to make sense of the situation by screaming \"I'M BLIND!\" since he is still wearing the blindfold. - The Langley family falls asleep waiting for Bean at the airport. What they don't know is that Bean actually HAS arrived at their house by way of a Taxi. He gets inside and plays around with a remote control for what he thinks is the TV but is actually the garage door opener. Bean then picks up a SONY Walkman for the first time and then starts to listen to music and do an impromptu dance in his pajamas all over the house. - The Langley's arriving home and Bean using their bathroom. Bean and David continue a set of 'near misses' as one goes outside the room as another comes in. Bean, searching for his toothpaste, comes across what he thinks is David's toothpaste but is actually a tube of medicinal toe cream. Bean puts it on his toothbrush, brushes and after a bit smiles and says \"Mmmm! Nice!\" - A lot more of Bean's destroying of Whistler's mother (A lot of the pictures for this scene can be found in the books for the film) is shown. Bean going into the Grierson Gallery men's room and attempting to wash off the ink by using a toilet brush. Hearing others who want to use the facilities, Bean places the painting outside a window and onto the building's ledge. He then walks out on the ledge and tries to grab it while trying not to disrupt the security meeting with David, Elmer, George, Bernice, and Walter. - Bean tries to calm David's panic over the destroyed painting by coming up with the idea of placing a tiny piece of paper saying \"DO NOT COME IN\" on the doors. David's reaction to this is \"EXCELLENT! It's perfect! Problem is solved! Apart from one tiny drawback, that someone will eventually walk through that door, they'll see the painting and say, \"Oh look, someone has completely destroyed 'Whistler's Mother'. Let's Kill Them!!!\" leaving Bean at a loss for words. - A 'breakfast' scene at the Langley's shows Bean making scrambled eggs and toast for David and Andrew while David tries to think of what to say at the unveiling. \"I get to go in and tell everyone that 'Whistler's Mother' now looks like Pinocchio's Father!\" - An extended scene of Burt Reynolds' character General Newton meeting the staff of the Grierson Gallery including Bean.",

The missing scenes are: - All of the scenes involving a character called the Crying Drunk Girl (Jennifer Elise Cox) who is so drunk that she has subtitles for when she speaks and she is the key to what is going on in movie. Her missing scenes of dialogue are: - After Preston and Denise talk with the Yearbook Girl, the Crying Drunk Girl walks up to them and says, \"Thush bezt weveram sisu gizem chext ear.\" (subtitle translation: \"This is the best party ever! I'm gonna miss you guys next year!) She group hugs them and walks away where Preston says, \"There's one at every party.\" - After Preston walks away from the Exchange Student at the backyard pool, the Crying Drunk Girl walks over to the Exchange Student and says to him, \"Idlik tach yre enis!\" (I'd like to touch your penis!) - When Kenny and Denise suddenly get locked in the upstairs bathroom and scream \"NOOOOO!!!\" the tracking shot from the bathroom door leads down the steps directly to the Crying Drunk Girl who somehow hears them and she says \"Yerd dum shelling yers chairs.\" (Did anyone hear that? Somebody's yelling for help upstairs!) But since no one can understand her, no help comes to Kenny or Denise. - When Amanda is talking to the Stoned Guy and the Watermelon Guy about who Preston is, the Crying Drunk Girl stumbles over to Amanda, leans on her shoulder, and says: \"Snow stun shy is shy sumber shess sing.\" (I know who Preston Meyers is. I can give you his phone number, his address, anything.) Unable to understand her, Amanda just shrugs her off and walks away. - During the police raid, one of the cops is talking to the Crying Drunk Girl on the front lawn of the house who asks her to stop crying and speak clearly and she says, \"I allred tdya, mnwans is mray hunds, ive at seveithg nolfok. (But I already told you! My name is Mary Hampson and I live and 1781 Norfolk!) Unable to understand her, the cop puts in her in a police van with Kenny's two Homboys and others who include the Hippy Girl, the Headbanger and others. - Also deleted was the scene involving the Stoned Girl (Amber Benson) who is glimpsed holding a banana as William walks through the kitchen to taste his first beer. It takes place in between the scenes where Kenny hits on Ashley and Jana where he sees her leaning against a dining room shelf and talks to her, but all she says is \"Okay\" everything he says. Then another girl walks in and thanks Kenny for finding her and says that Stephanie (the name of the Stoned Girl) just took three thingies of herbal ecstasy is so out of it. The girlfriend helps the Stoned Girl to her feet and they leave, leaving Kenny alone and downbeat. - Also deleted was the original opening which takes place in a bookstore the day before the graduation where Preston is talking to Denise about his desire for Amanda and his plans for going away to college. - When Kenny and his two homeboys first arrive at the party, Kenny plays around with a large sheepdog, named Mr. Tuxford, at the front door who belongs to the Girl Whose Party It Is, who jumps onto Kenny licking his face where he pushes the dog away who runs out the front door and the Girl runs after him. - There is more dialogue after when Kenny and Denise are released from the upstairs bathroom where the Girl Whose Party It Is continues yelling at Kenny and about the destruction they brought to her house as they are walking down the stairs where the house is now completely deserted and ransacked, and then the Girl's dog runs into the house and she drops to one knee and hugs the dog while Kenny takes this distraction to walk out and follow Denise. - A scene where the Watermelon Guy holds up a large watermelon and says \"This was in my freezer since September and I've poured six bottles of vodka into it and I've been saving it for this time!\" When all the guys around him grab at it, the watermelon falls on the kitchen floor splattering. - A scene in the \"make-out room\" where Mike Dexter enters looking for Amanda in the basement lit with dim red light and he turns on the basement lights revealing a dozen or more scantly clad boys and girls necking and shirtless William is among them with one of the Groupies and another girl. William gets up, puts on a blue band shirt, turns the lights back off and follows Mike upstairs after saying he remembers what he was supposed to do tonight. - During the raid when the Yearbook Girl tries getting her yearbook floating on the swimming pool after William throws it in, she falls head first into the pool. She climbs out and runs into a group of kids running from the cops and falls back in the pool again. Then the Reminiscing Guy appears, pulls her out with of the pool as her savior with her yearbook and they make their getaway. - More scenes with William and the Stoned Guy who put marijuana in the mini dinosaur and inhales from the mouth and then gives it to William for a try. - As Preston is walking away from the trash cans after throwing away his letter to Amanda, he passes by a car where a girl's leg is sticking out of a window and the unmistakable sounds of lovemaking are heard from the car. - An extended scene with Kenny and his two Homeboys in the convenience store where they are talking while they are bringing their stuff to the cash register to purchase. - In the scene where the Hippy Girl is tasting a marijuana brownie with the Hippy Guy, she tells him that he's supposed to melt the weed in with the butter, not put it in the mix and then says: \"these brownies suck!\" and then throws it in the direction of Denise. - The final scene at the diner is expanded with a shot from the Yearbook Girl and the Reminiscing Guy looking at some romance between them, the shot moves to the next booths where they show the band of the bass player, drummer, guitarist and lead singer trying to make sense about the night before, to the Foreign Exchange Student and the Crying Drunk Girl having found each other and both talking in incoherent, nonsense language and understanding each other, to at least two other booths, including the Girl Whose Party it was, before stopping at the booth with Mike Dexter and his jock friends. - The final parts of 'where the characters are now' were changed. The original Kenny and Denise part originally read: Denise dumped Kenny later that day. Denise went to NYU, where she found a whole bunch of people just like her. Bored at it all, she dropped out and started shooting photo covers for Rolling Stone Magazine. She currently directed the latest music video for Wu-Tang Clan. - The original Kenny bit read: Kenny went to UCLA and found a bunch of people just like him. Unable to compete, he reinvented himself as an eco-conscious vegan nudist. He currently lives with a cult in Northern California. - Other character bios read: William's friends, Geoff Piccirilli and Murphy Pelan, did not go to college. They created a comic book called Citizen X about a man with no identity, no Social Security number, nothing, who uses his anonymity to infiltrate numerous conspiracies involving the government, aliens, and the abduction and subsequent probing of them and other innocent people by extraterrestrials. They are currently dating no one. - Another character quote reads: Amanda's cousin, Ron, is currently in prison. - The Girl Whose Party It Is was also featured and it reads: The Girl Whose Party It Was, Molly Stinson, dropped out of college her freshman year to work as an intern for her role model, Martha Stewart. Three months later, she was hospitalized for a nervous breakdown. She is currently working as a librarian. - The Crying Drunk Girl's character read: The Crying Drunk Girl, Mary Hampson, attended college for nearly two years, then dropped out to become a tour guide at the White House, a job she still holds. Her favorite times at work is leading groups of school children in an enthusiastic rendition of the Pledge of Allegiance.",

Bennett's death was also trimmed to remove focus on his suffering. The 2001 UK DVD release retained these cuts and also added a further 44 seconds of distributor cuts. This was because the DVD master used for the UK release was a censored German cut. All cuts were fully waived in 2007 by the BBFC. The heavily edited 2001 UK version, with a total of 56 seconds removed, was also used as the master for the initial Australian DVD release. In this version additional edits include: - In the opening scene, after Cooke ('Bill Duke (I)' (qv)) has initially shot the man in the robe, he walks over to the body and shoots him again. This second hit has been removed. - When Matrix breaks Henriques' ('Charles Meshack' (qv)) neck on the plane, he simply elbows him, and in the next shot, Henrqiues is already dead. The shot of Matrix snapping Henriques neck is gone. - The shot of the piece of wood sticking through Cooke's stomach is absent. - All close ups of the pole in Bennett's ('Vernon Wells (I)' (qv)) stomach are gone.",

Most profanity, especially during the scene with John Travolta and Nancy Allen arguing while he is driving, is re-looped to remove bad language.

        "There are several differences between the video release and the original TV version. In addition to the title being changed, several scenes are cut from the video release. Cut scenes include: - Pop Tate good-naturedly chiding Archie as he discounts Archie's claim to have seen the Concorde fly into town - Archie's high school flashback in which he discusses with Jughead his dilemma over who to take to the prom (takes place as he first sees Betty and Veronica at the reunion) - Jordan and Max speculating on which of them can think of worse pranks to play on Archie - Betty's high school flashback in which she and Veronica promise each other not to be angry no matter who Archie asks to the prom (takes place during their tennis game--this scene first mentions Ronnie's dream of marrying a tall Frenchman, which she later tells Archie that she did) - Jordan putting green gelatin dessert into the foot of Archie's bed, Archie's discovery of said gelatin while he is on the phone with Pam, and his claim the next morning to have taken the dessert off his feet and put it back into the bowl (claim made as Jordan is eating the tainted gelatin) - Archie's high school flashback in which Betty informs him she is giving up hope for their relationship, and she is leaving town after graduation to pursue a writing career (takes place after she walks away from him in the library, but before he stops her from leaving) - The beginning of the junkyard scene, when Jughead tells his son that the junkyard holds the old gang's ghosts, Jughead and Archie discuss Archie's dilemma in choosing between Betty, Veronica, and Pam, and Jordan shows them a Hank Aaron-autographed baseball mitt he found. The scene picks up when the trio arrive in the vicinity of the jukebox. - Archie's high school flashback in which he asks Veronica to the prom, but she turns him down and informs him that she will be moving to France to go to college after graduation (takes place during their embrace as they walk through the park) - Reggie asking Archie to put in a good word for him with Ronnie in exchange for his trying to persuade Mr. Lodge not to evict Pop Tate, and Veronica's appearance out of the blue to kiss Archie--and changing Reggie's mind on his offer. - Robert and Pam exchanging names and shaking hands while the Archies sing \"Jingle Jangle\"",

These animations were replaced in the AIP re-edit by stills of some of the winged creatures. - The music score was changed - the new music was composed by Lex Baxter. Wilfred Joseph did the original score. - All topless nudity was removed from the AIP re-edit. This involved trimming several scenes and re-framing others (zooming in on the \"unoffensive\" part of the frame). This chopped about 3m off the running time. - The death of Essay Persson was abridged - In the middle section of the film some other scenes were re-positioned in the narrative with the intent of bringing forward the appearance of the coven (in order to speed up the narrative).

From September, 1986 to November, 1992, 65 episodes from the 70's and 80's of the show played on PBS in severely altered re-runs. Altered in the sense that everything except the running storyline of the episode was cut, resulting in the running time dropping from one hour to 12 to 17 minutes.  To fill the running time, elements from the 1981-1982 \"Wake up\" version (none of which were made into PBS versions), and other late episodes, such as Bill Cosby's \"Picture Pages\" segments, and scenes with Kevin Clash's troupe of puppets, making each episode around 28 minutes on PBS.  These versions also featured a new theme song (the much more upbeat \"Here Comes Captain Kangaroo!\" theme replaced the CBS \"Good Morning, Captain\" opening) and opening credit segment,  showing clips from the series rather than the previous, partly animated opening. One of the many hour-long videos released in 1984-1986 (when the show was between homes) was \"Captain Kangaroo and His Friends\".  This tape featured PBS-like versions of the episodes featuring Joan Rivers, Phil Donahue, and Dolly Parton, as well as scenes with Town Clown and the Bananna Man.\tNew intro's with the Captain were also inserted.\tReportedly, this has been aired as a special on PBS during pledge drives while the show was on the air.",

The film sat on a shelf for almost 25 years until actress Lea Lander rescued it from oblivion by helping finance a DVD release: a new short prologue was shot, according to Bava's original script, and editing and scoring were completed using existing available materials.  In 2002 producer Alfredo Leone and director Lamberto Bava (Mario's son), allegedly dissatisfied with the DVD edit, produced a new restored version of the film.  Lamberto Bava and his son Roy shot additional footage and original composer Stelvio Cipriani created a new complete musical score (though the DVD release employed some of Cipriani's cues and themes, the film was never properly scored in 1974).  This restored version, produced by Kismet Entertainment Group and retitled \"Kidnapped\", premiered theatrically in the US on May 31, 2002 as part of a Mario Bava retrospective at the American Cinematheque's Egyptian Theater in Hollywood",

Altogether, there are 13 separate stories consisting of 52 episodes. In Germany however, for 12 of the 13 stories the four original episodes were cut to three episodes for one story, each with a runtime of about 25 minutes (PAL). In the German version only one story consists of all 4 episodes with the full runtime. This means, that in Germany all 13 stories were shown, but only 40 episodes were dubbed and broadcast. In the German version 12 stories, which originally have a runtime of approximately 100 minutes (PAL), were shortened by about 25 minutes to 75 minutes (PAL), and many sequences and even some important story lines are missing. There was also a \"Captain Future\" special named \"Star Trail To Glory\" (in French: \"La course \u00e0 travers le syst\u00e8me solaire\") consisting of two episodes (as a result, there are 54 episodes altogether), which is available in France on video and DVD as a movie. These two episodes have never been shown (or dubbed) in Germany.",

The Ultimate Edition also includes several deleted scenes: - when Conan and Subotai first enter the village, they are shown stopping by a vendor (played by director John Milius) selling lizard-on-a-stick. The vendor says, \"Want food? This is on a stick...fresh. Quick, there are many to feed!\" Shortly thereafter in the film, Conan remarks that the food is good, to which Subotai replies, \"You have no idea how long it's been there!\" - a scene of silhouettes on a wall fighting - a cut scene of King Osric being attacked and killed in his throne-room by (presumably) Doom's soldiers - another cut scene of King Osric's demise, shot from a different angle, which ends with him staring at the reflection of his dying self in a mirror astride the throne, which he then shatters with his sword before collapsing An outtake is also included that takes place just after Conan is freed from bondage, and is climbing the rocks leading to the Atlantean General's tomb, and is being pursued by wild dogs. As Arnold is climbing, one of the dogs reaches him, biting him, and a crew member runs on-screen to intervene as Arnold shouts \"Goddamnit!\" in pain.",

Footage includes facial explosions and several scientists exploding at the gut in lingering slow-motion. - 19 seconds cut from warehouse sequence showing criminals exploding at the gut after unwisely standing amongst alien pods. - 2 seconds cut from warehouse sequence in which remains of freshly-exploded men are shown. - 9 seconds cut from climax, in which man's head is devoured by queen alien. - 11 seconds cut from climax showing a scientist exploding at the gut after being shot by Ian McCulloch. - 33 seconds cut from climax showing chief villain's chest exploding in slow-motion viscera-launch spectacle.

When Molly and Melvin pull out their contest tickets to show Serena, Molly says \"You blew it, Melvin\"; a comment which doesn't seem connected to anything. Another odd translation is when the girls gang up on Amy for saying that she wants to \"witness\" the contest.  In Japanese, she says that she might learn something from the contest.  The other girls want to know what Amy thinks she needs to learn from a lover's contest - and who she needs to learn it for! Later, when Amara immediately finds Michelle's hand in the first contest event, Ami says (in Japanese) \"I wonder if it's that kind of relationship.\" That's why the girls all look at Ami and Ami looks embarrassed.  In English, Amy makes some sort of neutral comment. In English, one of the girls comments that Michelle and Amara are cousins. The English episode gets really mixed up in that the translators can't seem to decide if it's a \"Friendship Contest\" or a \"Love Contest\".  At the beginning they go to great effort to make it a \"Friendship\" contest, but then the part where Amara is embarrassed to call out Michelle's name doesn't make sense. At the end, when Melvin makes his love confession to Molly, the translators seem to give up on \"Friendship\" and it becomes a \"Love\" contest again. When the couples go to confess their love, one man charges towards the woman yelling something about love being a battle.  She conks him over the head with a giant mallet.

        "The Serbian DVD version is 160 minutes long and is a significantly different cut from any other DVD or video releases. There is no opening map and narration. The musical score is the original Vladimir Kraus-Rajteric score which kicks in very rarely. The scenes are rearranged so that Welles makes his speech to the troops near the beginning and the air attack hits Bihac simultaneously with the land battle. Almost every dialog scene is lengthened and cut slower than the English version, but there are some parts of the action scenes cut a lot tighter. For instance, this is missing the scene where Riva falls out of the truck during the Italian retreat. It is also missing the scene in the Orthodox church prior the Welles addressing the Chetniks. However, it does feature several new scenes, most notably a scene where Vasco raids a house in Prosor only to then shoot and wound his own commander, and then a second battle between the Partisans and the Italians. In this scene, Riva refuses to fire at his own men and Novak almost shoots him only for Martin to intervene. General Morelli is captured and then promptly commits suicide with a pistol. There is also a new scene where the partisans surprise attack a group of Chetniks guarding the Neretva bridge. There are several more violent shots missing from other prints - such as the Ustashans hanging an old woman and laughing when they march through Bihac. There are several more deaths during the end battle with the Chetniks such as a partisan being shot in the back when reaching for a grenade. Then at the end of the battle there is a scene where a partisan named 'Stipe' goes crazy and guns down a number of Chetnik prisoners, only to have his rank stripped from him. Curiously almost all the nationalities speak their own language; with Riva speaking Italian even with his Yugoslavian captors and Morelli speaking in German when addressing General Lohring. The only actors dubbed appear to be Yul Brynner and Orson Welles.",

The French DVD includes both versions (via seamless branching), while the U.S. Criterion DVD features the cut footage as an extra. The PAL releases run 97 minutes. This shorter version makes the following changes: - An early scene in which Sada has sex with Ishida while playing a shamisen has been cut by about a minute and a half. In the original version, Sada seemingly goes unconscious and Ishida checks for her heartbeat. - A brief shot (12 seconds) of Ishida and Sada on a bridge has been added to the scene in which the couple goes out walking at night. - A later scene (in which the geishas assault one of their own with a dildo) is cut by 14 seconds to remove a shot of Ishida and Sada's faces in mid-copulation. - An entire two-minute scene is deleted about an hour into the film. This scene features Sada and Ishida having sex behind a thin screen, while Ishida speaks of the \"darkness\" he feels inside Sada. - The scene in which Sada first strangles Ishida is cut by just over one minute. In the short version, the scene ends when Ishida starts coughing and Sada releases his throat. In the original version, Ishida asks her to resume, which she does (only to stop when he begins coughing again). - The scene in which Ishida becomes drowsy while having sex with Sada is edited differently. The original version has slightly different dialogue and has an additional minute of footage where Ishida actually does fall asleep for a short time. - The scene in which Sada wakes up after her final night with Ishida is cut by one minute. The original version shows Sada lying on the floor and apparently panicking, walking around the room and opening doors for no obvious reason.

        "The R2 Special Edition (available on the Alien Quadrology Boxset as well as separately) contains 7 extra minutes of altered and/or extended scenes. As a result, there is a little more character development, but the music has also been re-edited (a bit poorly) in some scenes. Here follows a short description: - The main titles (the distorted shots of the 7 early Ripley clones in the theatrical cut) have been replaced by an alternate opening, which starts with a close-up of a growling alien mouth. As the camera pulls back, it is revealed to be the beak of a fly, that is subsequently squashed by a thumb of a soldier. The soldier uses a straw to blow the fly's blood against a window, which shows that he is actually sitting in a nacell of the Auriga spaceship. The rest of the shot shows the Auriga slowly flying away from camera. - Directly after the chestburster has been surgically removed from Ripley 8, she wakes up from her narcosis, grips the surgeon's arm and breaks it. - In the scene where Ripley is shown drawings of a glove and fruit, directly after Genral Perez, Wren and Gediman leave, the doctor shows Ripley a drawing of a young, blond girl, which seems to trigger an emotional memory in her. - During the meal scene, Ripley repeats Gediman's 'Fiori 16', and he asks her what she remembers. Dr. Wren can also tells some more about the Weyland-Yutani company (\"bought up by Wall-Mart\") - The 'Betty introduction scene has been completely re-edited and extended. The scene now starts with the Betty flying towards the Auriga, Elgyn giving the clearance code over the radio (E-A-T-M-E), but now he flirts some more with Hillard, and warns Call and Vriess over the intercom to get ready. Next, Call and Vriess are shown working on the cargo, followed by some extended dialogue in which Vriess tells Call an obscene joke. This is followed by the scene in which Christie gets his hidden weapons (which came first in the original cut). Next is Johner's 'target practice', Vriess then throws a tool to his head, Call calls him names, but Johner simply replies by asking for his knife. When Vriess comments on his alcoholism, Johner demans his knife back, Call breaks it, Johner threatens her, and there is an extra line from Vriess that he and Cal deserve better company. - During the deal between Elgyn and Perez, Elgyn has some more 'flattering' remarks about Call, thinking Vriess has an eye on her. After Elgyn asks Perez for three days bed and board, Perez agrees under a few conditions (no tresspassing in restricted areas, no trouble, no fighting). - After Purvis shouts \"What's in-f###ing-side me?!?\", Wren answers: \"A parasite! A foreign element!\" After Call says that Purvis can be frozen and operated later, she has another run-in with Johner, followed by Christie agreeing that Purvis comes, but saying he will shoot him if he starts acting funny. - Just before everyone takes a dive through the flooded kitchen, Christie and DiStephano have a short conversation on Christie's weapons ('the disposable kind'), and Call reminds everyone to take a deep breath. - In the chapel, just after Purvis' fake chestburst, there is an extended line from Call, stating she recalibrated ground level, sending the ship into an uninhabited quadrant of Earth, before she mentions time of impact. After Ripley asks if she's the new a##hole model, she replies she couldn't let humanity annihilate itself. Ripley comments that she once tried to save people as well; she remembers a girl that had bad dreams, but she died despite her help, and now she can't even remember her name. After DiStephano enters to take them with him, Ripley asks Call if she dreams, which Call does thanks to neural processors; Ripley says she dreams about the aliens every night, and that she used to be afraid, but not anymore, since it is always worse when she wakes up. - After Johner kissed Vriess for getting them safely through Earth's atmosphere, there is an alternate ending with the Betty landing on Earth. Call warns Ripley for the military that will come looking for her soon. She says someone can get pretty lost on Earth, and asks Ripley what to do. Ripley replies that she doesn't know, since she is a stranger there herself. The camera then goes up, to reveal a post-apocalyptical Paris.",

This version has the following scenes reinstated: - A guardsman named Mr. Widdenfield (played by Arthur Malet) harasses Captain Greer, while Mrs. Hobday tries to clear things out (leading into the song \"The Old Home Guard\"). - A Home Guard sergeant asking for permission to dismiss the marching parade (immediately after \"The Old Home Guard\" ends). - Mr. Jelk tells Mrs. Hobday of his plans to buy Miss Price's house. - At dinner time, Carrie tells Miss Price she and her brothers are orphans, while she explains what happened to their caretaker, Aunt Bessie. - Miss Price notes mango-wurzel jam is available at the dinner table, and they say grace, as the children look disgusted at Miss Price's tastes in food. - Miss Price tells the children no one has ever seen her workroom before. - As Mr. Jelk brings a letter to Miss Price (the one that informs her the Emelius Browne Correspondence College of Witchcraft has closed), he tries to get into the house and talk to her, but she politely sends him away. - When Miss Price asks Paul for the bedknob back to get to London, Charlie attempts to extort some money from her, but she rebuffs him. - After \"The Age of Not Believing,\" Paul tries to get the bed to fly, but Miss Price forgot to tell him to tell the knob where to take them. - When the children find Mr. Browne on the streets of London, they take the bed with them and follow him. - The entire song \"With a Flair\" and its lead-in, as well as Mr. Browne's subsequent offer to sell his magic props. - When Miss Price says \"we'd be delighted [to join Mr. Browne for luncheon],\" Mr. Browne asks if the children belong to her. - At the townhouse where Mr. Browne is staying, Miss Price explains to her what substitutiary locomotion is and why she wants the spell. - The second nursery scene, in which Paul discovers the book \"Isle of Naboombu,\" is put before \"Eglantine\", whereas it was formerly after it. - The song \"Eglantine\" is restored to its entirety. - The song \"Portobello Road\" is restored to its entirety, as its subsequent dance sequence. The main song adds a scene with a used clothing merchant and another scene where Charlie and Paul play cricket. In the dance, the Caribbean dance now precedes the Irish dance. Unlike the rest of the formerly cut scenes, the tail end of the Irish dance and the beginning of the dance's climax only existed as a faded work-print that had to be digitally scanned and cleaned before it could be brought back to a passable state. - Mr. Browne tells Swinburne that the bed once belonged to royalty and is being offered to the Bookman as a present, while the children push the bed through the door. - Mr. Browne rebuffs the Bookman's offer to swap sections of the book, but relents when he is threatened. - A scene in the village store where Mrs. Hobday meets Mr. Browne and suggests he should marry Miss Price. Mr. Jelk walks in and overhears them. - The song \"Nobody's Problem's for Me\" is reinstated after Mr. Browne leaves the house. No orchestral track existed, so the studio recorded a new one.",

Grace informs Norm and Jake about it. - The squad reaches the abandoned school. It reveals that Grace teaches English to the Na'vi children until a serious incident came about (bullet holes around, etc..) which was insinuated about. - Jake and Neytiri tripping through the neon-light woods is slightly longer. - When Jake joins the circle, a little Na'vi girl smiles at him curiously, but her father holds her back. Neytiri then arrives and hands Jake a fruit. - Jake tries to ask Neytiri her name, but she seems annoyed by that. - Jake, Grace and Norm proceed from the helicopter to the secluded laboratory. There's an explanation about the mountains. - At night, Jake and Neytiri run through the luminescent forest. - After Jake touches the Fan Lizard, it flies away in a radiant glow. Its fellow species follow suit and, to the delight of Jake and Neytiri, raise themselves into the air. - As Jake and the other Na'vi climb the mountain, Neytiri flies past them on a Seze. - The Na'vi goes for an aerial hunt for Stuurmbeast. Jake shoots one and exclaims in excitement. Neytiri follow suit as well. - The Na'vi destroy the Hell Trucks of the mining company. - The next morning, Wainfleet's squad sifts through the remains of the Hell Trucks. Turns out that Na'vi kill the soldiers as well. Quaritch and Selfridge watch the live broadcast. - Tsu'tey's fall from the sky is longer. A few plants decelerate and break his fall. - The Hammerhead Titanotheres has been extended. - The fight between Neytiri on a Thanathor and Quaritch is slightly longer. - Tsu'Tey's death: he knows he is dying and appoints Jake to be his successor. He insists Jake to kill him because by Na'vi customs, Jake has to pass him to the Eywa by killing him by his own hands. Neytiri starts to cry. Jake reluctantly complies with his wish, stabbing him by the knife as the camera passes by him. - The end credits has an addition of using Discovery Zone's Bless the Plague soundtrack. The copyright year has been replaced with 2010.",

Disney could not locate any film footage of this number, but they found the audio tracks and still photographs of the number. The restoration team created a still-photo recreation to include as a supplement; it has appeared on most home video versions of the 139-minute cut. Because it was done on tape and because it was decided audiences might find the switch from live action to still photos jarring, it was left out of the film's reconstruction.

Spelling took offense and thought that it was a reference to his daughter Tori Spelling who was a star on \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" a series created by Darren Star and produced by Aaron Spelling. Before the pilot aired Star took out all references to how Marcy got her job, a scene in which Marcy threw up in a limo and even went as far as to digitally alter her hair so that it was brown and not red. Joely Fisher, who played producer Hope Lustig, was originally credited in the opening titles but was removed after the first episode when she decided to leave the show to work on \"Normal, Ohio\" a sitcom which was canceled.

        "The Anchor Bay special edition DVD, released in 2002, contains six deleted scenes (a couple of which also appear on the LD), cut by Ken Russell for pacing, time and conventionality reasons, and some brief additional dialogue during the China Blue/Adrian car ride. The six scenes, which have optional commentary by Barry Sandler noting why they were removed, are: - An additional barbecue scene with Bobby and Donny reminiscing about screwing the loosest girl in high school (whom everyone was lining up to screw). Bobby confesses that he never went through with it, because he had just started seeing Amy. Amy and Sheila (Yvonne McCord) then have a discussion in the garage about unhappy marriages and unexciting lives. Sheila admits that the happiest time of her life was when she left Donny, Amy tells her that Bobby tries so hard to make things work, and Sheila advises her to dump him and stop wasting his time. This was bracketed in the film by the limo scene with China Blue, Arthur and Claudia. (5m 11s) - Joanna and Bobby lie in bed post-coitus. She has her doubts about letting her cover down, a fight erupts, and he storms out of her apartment to go stay at Donny's. (2m 3s) - Joanna knocks on Bobby's door, as she now needs him. She wants to try again, and he's happy to comply. Appeared in the film after Joanna leaves Ben's (Gerald S. O'Loughlin) and Adrian's (Peggy Feury) house. (1m 4s) - Joanna sits in her car, parked outside the Grady family home, so she can see how his other side lives. Amy drives home with Jimmy, tells him to go wait inside, chides Joanna (aware that she's the other woman) for daring to come to her house, and both women spill their guts. Appeared in the film in between the scenes of Joanna slamming the door in Bobby's face after their reconciliation and Amy giving Bobby his old football jersey. (2m 53s) - Bobby enters Jimmy's bedroom and helps him with a diorama of the solar system. He tells his son that he's not staying, and Jimmy begs him to, because he promised he would be. Appeared in the film after the scene where Amy gives Bobby his old football jersey. (1m 20s) - Bobby shares a drink in a bar with a very drunk Donny. He tells Donny about Joanna and that he just said goodbye to Amy and the kids, before he heads off to see Joanna. Donny then tries and fails to pick up a woman, who's revolted by him. Appeared in the film in the middle of Reverend Shayne's attack on Joanna. (2m 53s) Some versions, such as the Anchor Bay DVD, have the \"It's a Lovely Life\" video out of sync with the music, and the camera's-eye views of Bobby filming China Blue and Reverend Shayne in B&W (which is how they are in the longform music video), instead of blue-tint. For some odd reason, the DVD removes the New World Pictures copyright ((c)Copyright 1984 New World Pictures All Rights Reserved.) in the end credits, replacing it with a cheap video insert ((c)1984 New World Pictures. All Rights Reserved.) after all the credits have rolled.",

In the theatrical version, Scott describes his planned evening as \"a titty movie on Skinemax.\" On TBS, he says \"a porno movie on cable.\" Later, Dr. Evil asks Scott if he wants to see what Daddy does for a living. Scott's response is \"Blow me,\" which he follows up with \"Show me\" when Dr. Evil asks him to repeat that. In the TBS version, Scott says \"Bite me,\" which he follows up with \"Might be fun.\" - The line \"I never forget a pussy ... cat\" has been redubbed \"I never forget a kitty ... cat\", which ruins the joke. - Two versions of the \"lifeboat\" alternate ending were broadcast on TBS. In one, Basil arrives hanging from a helicopter. He gives Vanessa her full accreditation as a field agent, and gives Austin the card of a dental specialist. In the second ending, after Austin and Vanessa kiss we are treated to a roll-call of the major characters and what happened to them, as the \"Great Escape March\" plays in the background.",

The differences are as follows (includes Spoilers): - In the PG-13 version, Shannon Elizabeth's character Becky is simply dragged away by the wolf at the end of the opening sequence. In the unrated version, Becky is torn in half and her bloodied upper-torso is tossed back at Jimmy and Ellie. - In the PG-13 version, during Ellie's nightmare, she merely bites Joshua Jackson's character Jake in the neck. The scene then cuts to a quick montage of bizarre images before Ellie wakes up. In the unrated version, after Ellie bites into Jake, she's shown ripping a large chunk of his neck off and then a torrent of blood shoots out of his wound. - In the PG-13 version, after Joanie knocks out Jake she starts looking for Ellie and Jimmy. In the unrated version, she first stops by Kyle's body, digs into the large gash in his stomach with her hands, pulls them out and then licks his blood off her fingers before proceeding to look for Ellie and Jimmy. - In the unrated version, Joanie (in wolf form) is killed when she is shot in the head and her brains slowly ooze onto the floor. - In the PG-13 version, the coroner discovers that Joanie's corpse has changed back into human form when her nude body is shown laying on the floor. In the unrated version, a sheet over her body is pulled back and only her face, complete with a bullet hole in her forehead, is shown. - In the PG-13 version, Jake's death by decapitation occurs off-camera. In the unrated version, Ellie is actually shown stabbing him in the neck with the shovel a couple of times before finally cutting his head off.",

        "A longer director's cut, titled \"Apocalypse Now Redux\", debuted on 11 May 2001 at the Cannes film festival. This cut was re-edited by Coppola and Walter Murch and features a new Technicolor dye prints with additional footage originally left out of thetheatrical release. The new version is 197 minutes long (53 minutes longer than the original version). The restored footage also includes the French plantation scenes with Aurore Clement and Christian Marquand, as well as scenes from the crew meeting the Playmates later on. - There are additional scenes when the crew is with Kilgore. During the napalm strike, he helps a wounded Vietnamese child. The napalm strike has ruined the favorable surfing conditions, so Lance and the others leave, much to Kilgore's dismay. Before they leave, Willard steals Kilgore's surfboard. Finally, just before Willard and Chef leave the boat to search for mangoes, a helicopter files by with Kilgore on loudspeaker, asking for his surfboard back. - In the Playmate scenes, Willard trades two drums of oil in exchange for spending two hours with the Bunnies. We see Chef with Miss May in a helicopter, and Lance with the Playmate of the Year in a ransacked house. Miss May was once a bird trainer at Busch Gardens and tries to talk about birds with Chef while he is busy trying to get her to re-enact her photo that he showed the crew. They end up kissing and Miss May gets excited because Chef kisses like a bird. The Playmate of the Year is talking to Lance about her troubles and insecurities about being a Playmate. Clean is seen trying to barge in on both men, and when he barges in on Lance, the Playmates open a chest (in which to hide) and discovers a dead Vietnamese. Lance comforts her. Chef finds out afterwards that Clean is a virgin and starts calling him names on the boat. Willard told Chief that the whole crew can spend time with the Bunnies, but Chief refuses. - At the plantation, Chef figures that they are French first and tells them in French that they are Americans and are friends. They bury Clean with his tape player there, and eat dinner with the French. The crew eats with the staff, and Willard eats with the family. Chef wants to speak to the chef but is informed he only speaks Vietnamese. Willard is lectured about France's colonial history in Indochine as well as their military blunders. There also is a scene with Willard and Roxanne, one of the French women, smoking opium. - At the Kurtz compound, Willard is imprisoned in an oven-like box. Kurtz appears, accompanied by a group of children. He reads to Willard from Time magazine articles about the Vietnam War.",

        "When Blind Fury was being prepared for TV in the early 90s, many changes were made to the finished film, adding short extensions here and there, as well as alternate \"TV friendly\" takes of various lines. Here's the full list of changes: 1. Alternate take: Billy sticks his tongue out at Nick to \"test\" his blindness, rather than giving him the finger as in the theatrical cut. 2. Deleted shot: Billy runs outside along his backyard pool, with a tracking shot revealing more of his dinosaur sculptures 3. Extended scene: Lynn mentions Frank not discussing the war, prior to Nick pouring the tea (thus, the \"he never even talked about the war\" line is removed later on). She later further expresses the difficulties of divorce. 4. Extended shot: After the cop at the bus station checks on Nick and Billy, the shot continues well after they leave, with the cop still staring. Due to a deleted scene later, the \"I get the window seat...\" line is removed. 5. Deleted scene: Nick goes to the cashier at the bus station to buy two tickets to Reno, only for the cashier (realizing Nick is blind) to try to trick him by giving him less change. Nick, aware of this, points out the mistake, and also knocks off the cashier's toupee onto a Slurpee. It's at the end of this scene where we actually see Billy say the \"I get the window seat...\" line. 6. Deleted scene: When Nick and Billy first begin their bus trip, it initially begins with Billy using his inhaler, later to use it to wake Nick up. Billy then continually complains that he can't sleep on the bus, with Nick bluntly replying with \"then don't\". This scene takes place prior to Annie visiting Frank, and temporarily replaces the scene with Billy flopping around and hitting Nick on the bus as he sleeps. This latter scene instead is placed after the Annie/Frank scene in the TV cut. 7. Deleted shot: Prior to the bus scene with Nick telling Billy about his father, there's an extra shot of the bus driving into Graceland, complete with a \"Home of Elvis Presley\" sign. 8. Deleted scene: In the middle of Nick's chase after Billy in the cornfield, he actually manages to stop him at one point, with Billy exclaiming the fact that his mother's dead and his father doesn't want him. 9. Extended scene: At the end of the scene with Nick and Billy by the campfire, when Billy attempts to \"see\" what Nick's life is like by closing his eyes, he hears footsteps, only to discover a nearby deer. Nick asks Billy to describe it, and he responds saying it's \"like a real deer... not like in a zoo.\" And that it also looks \"free.\" 10. Extended scene: When Nick and Billy are trapped in the back of Lyle and Tector's van, there's an additional segment in which Billy looks around saying \"It's so dark in here\". Nick, sarcastically, simply replies \"I thought it was just me.\" 11. Alternate take: After Lyle and Tector steal the car from the two old women and shoot out the back window, the TV cut uses a take of Lyle exclaiming \"What the?\" as opposed to the theatrical cut's \"Jesus H. Christ!\" 12. Deleted shot: After the alternate \"What the?\" take, the film cuts back to the two old women, with the unarmed woman saying to the armed one \"You always forget to reload!\" 13. Alternate take: When the driver that Nick nearly runs off the road realizes the Nick is blind, he exclaims \"Holy cow!\" rather than the theatrical cut's \"Holy shit!\" 14. Deleted shot: When Annie sees Nick off to find Frank, she tells him that she thinks Frank was set up by MacReady. 15. Extended scene: After Nick leaves Billy and Annie to find Frank, Annie asks Billy \"What did he say to you?\" Billy says \"To hold down the fort and protect the women.\" Annie responds with \"It's good to know we're in such capable hands Billy. In as deep a voice as he can muster, Billy says \"It's Bill.\" 16. Deleted scene: After Nick escapes from the casino riot to the elevator, there's an additional scene in which he starts eating the food off of the room service tray, as well as dropping his cigar into the coffee pot. 17. Alternate take: When Nick disables the elevator that Lyle and Tector are riding in, rather than the theatrical cut's \"Shit! Fuck! Shit fuck!\", the TV cut uses a far more tame \"Dog! Gone! Dog gone!\" 18. Alternate take: When Nick asks Cobb where Frank is, the theatrical cut has Cobb respond with \"F.O., Errol Flynn. Do you know what that means? Fuck off!\". However, the TV cut dubs in the line \"G.T.H., Errol Flynn.\" in the same two-shot used in the theatrical cut, but uses new footage on the close up on Cobb, with his alternate response of \"Do you know what that means? Go to Hell!\" 19. Deleted scene: After Nick knocks out Cobb and takes the key, the TV cut jumps to an extra short scene in which the Casino guards try to push Lyle into the elevator shaft, only for him to crash back down. Tector then asks \"You okay?\" 20. Extended scene: When Nick and Frank try to find Annie and Billy, there's a long take of Frank asking \"anybody home?\" before searching the inside of the modified bus. This cuts to a longer POV shot of Frank walking through the bus. 21. Deleted shot: After Frank makes the deal on the phone with MacReady, there's an additional shot of Frank exclaiming \"What I wouldn't give!\" and then calming down to say to Nick \"I guess you don't get any second chances, though, do you?\" 22. Alternate take: At the end of the Winterhaven ambush scene, an alternate angle/take of Nick stabbing Cobb is used, in which the bloodied blade and the final stab aren't as prominent as they are in the theatrical cut. 23. Deleted scene: Before Nick and Frank make their way to meet MacReady, Frank steps in saying \"Nick, this way!\" 24. Extended ending: As Billy tries to stop Nick from leaving, the overall scene is longer, with Nick saying that Billy is becoming a man and that he promises that he will call and see him again. This version rarely appears on TV anymore, but was more recently spotted on Reelz Channel.",

        "Special Edition DVD features two deleted scenes with introduction by Renny Harlin: - The first deleted scene is called \"Ice Climb\" and falls right after the part when Stallone survives the avalanche as he's retrieving the first money case.  In this scene, he climbs up a frozen waterfall.  The scene which would have followed this was the one in the theatrical version where Stallone reaches the top of the mountain and runs to the lodge to meet Jessie.  According to Renny Harlin, the scene was cut because it didn't look real enough...the waterfall was a fiberglass wall and the background was optically inserted.  Also, they didn't want Stallone's character to appear invincible and be able to do anything, like in Rambo. - The second deleted scene is called \"King's Leap\" and occurs right after the scene where the bridge which connects the two mountain faces is destroyed. In this scene, Stallone does a running jump between the two mountain faces, and safely lands on the wall of the opposing cliff.  According to Renny Harlin, this was also cut because while climbers actually jump between mountain faces, the jump they had Stallone doing was a little to far to be believable.  They then got around the part of how Gabe & Jessie got around the mountain by having them backtrack and go all the way around.  Some audio was also re-recorded for that after the \"King's Leap\" was cut.. - Portions of both deleted scenes can be seen in the trailer for the movie",

As a result of the added narration, the enigmatic ending becomes easier to understand for North American viewers. The added narration actually creates a very large problem with the 'Polish with English subtitles' option on the Region 1 DVD, since the 'traslantion' subtitles are actually dub-titles (they simply transcribed the Enlgish dub as the Polish dialog). This results in innumerable inaccuracies in the script (almost all mention of the connections to the King Arthur myth are lost on any language of the Region 1 version), and the subtitles also show up during the sequences where the English version has narration, meaning that in the middle of a dialog-less scene, the subtitles will show up anyway. Miramax has not recalled or corrected the DVD, but an uncut anamorphic version with proper subtitles is available from UK company Blue Light.",

        "Global Film Enterprises produced the movie and then gave the distribution rights for certain countries (at least USA and UK) to Touchstone/Buena Vista (Disney). They changed the movie by removing the animated opening credits (instead they put opening credits over the very beginning of the movie and removed some dialogue) and by removing the original end (the day after the showdown Rocky fights one of bad guys at school and wins back his girl friend's, Colt's and his own bike). The German rental video and tv broadcasts show the unchanged movie (and there is no sign of a Touchstone logo). Due to the running time difference (US laserdisc 85 min. vs. German TV 93 min.) there may be more scenes removed by Touchstone.",

This \"new\" dub was actually created in the mid-60s by a Hong Kong company, to aid the production company in selling the film overseas. In Frank's version, the original Japanese title sequence has been replaced with English translated credits superimposed against an image of moving ocean water. The same stock shot of crashing waves was used for three of the other four Gamera films Sandy Frank re-edited.",
