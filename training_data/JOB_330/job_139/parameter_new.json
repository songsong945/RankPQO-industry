To fill the running time, elements from the 1981-1982 \"Wake up\" version (none of which were made into PBS versions), and other late episodes, such as Bill Cosby's \"Picture Pages\" segments, and scenes with Kevin Clash's troupe of puppets, making each episode around 28 minutes on PBS.  These versions also featured a new theme song (the much more upbeat \"Here Comes Captain Kangaroo!\" theme replaced the CBS \"Good Morning, Captain\" opening) and opening credit segment,  showing clips from the series rather than the previous, partly animated opening. One of the many hour-long videos released in 1984-1986 (when the show was between homes) was \"Captain Kangaroo and His Friends\".

Unable to understand her, Amanda just shrugs her off and walks away. - During the police raid, one of the cops is talking to the Crying Drunk Girl on the front lawn of the house who asks her to stop crying and speak clearly and she says, \"I allred tdya, mnwans is mray hunds, ive at seveithg nolfok. (But I already told you! My name is Mary Hampson and I live and 1781 Norfolk!) Unable to understand her, the cop puts in her in a police van with Kenny's two Homboys and others who include the Hippy Girl, the Headbanger and others. - Also deleted was the scene involving the Stoned Girl (Amber Benson) who is glimpsed holding a banana as William walks through the kitchen to taste his first beer. It takes place in between the scenes where Kenny hits on Ashley and Jana where he sees her leaning against a dining room shelf and talks to her, but all she says is \"Okay\" everything he says. Then another girl walks in and thanks Kenny for finding her and says that Stephanie (the name of the Stoned Girl) just took three thingies of herbal ecstasy is so out of it. The girlfriend helps the Stoned Girl to her feet and they leave, leaving Kenny alone and downbeat. - Also deleted was the original opening which takes place in a bookstore the day before the graduation where Preston is talking to Denise about his desire for Amanda and his plans for going away to college. - When Kenny and his two homeboys first arrive at the party, Kenny plays around with a large sheepdog, named Mr. Tuxford, at the front door who belongs to the Girl Whose Party It Is, who jumps onto Kenny licking his face where he pushes the dog away who runs out the front door and the Girl runs after him. - There is more dialogue after when Kenny and Denise are released from the upstairs bathroom where the Girl Whose Party It Is continues yelling at Kenny and about the destruction they brought to her house as they are walking down the stairs where the house is now completely deserted and ransacked, and then the Girl's dog runs into the house and she drops to one knee and hugs the dog while Kenny takes this distraction to walk out and follow Denise. - A scene where the Watermelon Guy holds up a large watermelon and says \"This was in my freezer since September and I've poured six bottles of vodka into it and I've been saving it for this time!\" When all the guys around him grab at it, the watermelon falls on the kitchen floor splattering. - A scene in the \"make-out room\" where Mike Dexter enters looking for Amanda in the basement lit with dim red light and he turns on the basement lights revealing a dozen or more scantly clad boys and girls necking and shirtless William is among them with one of the Groupies and another girl. William gets up, puts on a blue band shirt, turns the lights back off and follows Mike upstairs after saying he remembers what he was supposed to do tonight. - During the raid when the Yearbook Girl tries getting her yearbook floating on the swimming pool after William throws it in, she falls head first into the pool. She climbs out and runs into a group of kids running from the cops and falls back in the pool again. Then the Reminiscing Guy appears, pulls her out with of the pool as her savior with her yearbook and they make their getaway. - More scenes with William and the Stoned Guy who put marijuana in the mini dinosaur and inhales from the mouth and then gives it to William for a try. - As Preston is walking away from the trash cans after throwing away his letter to Amanda, he passes by a car where a girl's leg is sticking out of a window and the unmistakable sounds of lovemaking are heard from the car. - An extended scene with Kenny and his two Homeboys in the convenience store where they are talking while they are bringing their stuff to the cash register to purchase. - In the scene where the Hippy Girl is tasting a marijuana brownie with the Hippy Guy, she tells him that he's supposed to melt the weed in with the butter, not put it in the mix and then says: \"these brownies suck!\" and then throws it in the direction of Denise. - The final scene at the diner is expanded with a shot from the Yearbook Girl and the Reminiscing Guy looking at some romance between them, the shot moves to the next booths where they show the band of the bass player, drummer, guitarist and lead singer trying to make sense about the night before, to the Foreign Exchange Student and the Crying Drunk Girl having found each other and both talking in incoherent, nonsense language and understanding each other, to at least two other booths, including the Girl Whose Party it was, before stopping at the booth with Mike Dexter and his jock friends. - The final parts of 'where the characters are now' were changed. The original Kenny and Denise part originally read: Denise dumped Kenny later that day. Denise went to NYU, where she found a whole bunch of people just like her. Bored at it all, she dropped out and started shooting photo covers for Rolling Stone Magazine. She currently directed the latest music video for Wu-Tang Clan. - The original Kenny bit read: Kenny went to UCLA and found a bunch of people just like him. Unable to compete, he reinvented himself as an eco-conscious vegan nudist. He currently lives with a cult in Northern California. - Other character bios read: William's friends, Geoff Piccirilli and Murphy Pelan, did not go to college. They created a comic book called Citizen X about a man with no identity, no Social Security number, nothing, who uses his anonymity to infiltrate numerous conspiracies involving the government, aliens, and the abduction and subsequent probing of them and other innocent people by extraterrestrials. They are currently dating no one. - Another character quote reads: Amanda's cousin, Ron, is currently in prison. - The Girl Whose Party It Is was also featured and it reads: The Girl Whose Party It Was, Molly Stinson, dropped out of college her freshman year to work as an intern for her role model, Martha Stewart. Three months later, she was hospitalized for a nervous breakdown. She is currently working as a librarian. - The Crying Drunk Girl's character read: The Crying Drunk Girl, Mary Hampson, attended college for nearly two years, then dropped out to become a tour guide at the White House, a job she still holds. Her favorite times at work is leading groups of school children in an enthusiastic rendition of the Pledge of Allegiance.",

In the 1990's, as Steve Rogers is reviewing the deaths of Martin Luther King and John Kennedy and realizing that the Red Skull is to blame, the Red Skull is shown weeping over the piano seen at the end of the film, re-living the visitation of the Italian army storming into his house, shooting his family, and kidnapping him for their experiments.

        "The DVD release of the film contains several deleted and extended scenes with commentary from writer/director/star Craig Chester. The scenes are included in the film's novelization, also written by Chester. Most of the scenes were cut for time. The scenes featured on the DVD are: - An extended version of Adam's (Chester) opening visit to the support group - Adam saves Rhonda (Parker Posey) from a relapse into her food addiction at a barbecue restaurant - Adam recounts to Steve (Malcolm Gets) a sexual experience he had with a mime - Adam and Steve get ready to go country dancing - An extended version of the party at Steve's apartment, including more scenes with Jeff and Jeff's adopted daughter Ling-Ling - An extended version of Michael (Chris Kattan) telling Adam about Steve's past - Adam and Steve have a fight after Steve's party - An extended version of the dinner party with Adam, Steve, and Steve's parents - Michael wakes up to find Steve is not home and realizes he doesn't know how to operate without him (he tries to make coffee and realizes he doesn't know how) - Rhonda and Michael make out when Michael tempts Rhonda with a pie, which promptly ends up covering them both (Craig Chester admits that the scene was cut due to massive technical difficulties in staging it)",

        "A 113 minute 70mm workprint was shown at the some sneak previews in Dallas and Denver in 1982. The film scored extremely poorly from the test audiences, and it was this poor reaction which led to the happy ending and the voice-over narration. In 1989, sound preservationist 'Michael Arick' (qv) came across a 70mm print of Blade Runner in the TODD-AO vaults. Thinking it was the International Cut, Arick purchased the print for Warners, who loaned it out to the Los Angeles Cineplex-Odeon Fairfax Theatre in 1990 for a festival of 70mm prints. It was at this screening that people realized they were watching the Dallas/Denver Workprint. The film was subsequently screened at UCLA's Los Angeles Perspectives Multimedia Festival in 1991. A 35mm reduction of this version was later shown at the NuArt Theatre and the Art Deco Castro Theater in San Francisco in 1991. It was the success of these four screenings that prompted Warner Bros. to look into the possibility of releasing a Director's Cut of the film. The workprint briefly resurfaced again, by accident, for a one-week engagement (1/15 - 1/21) at the Seattle, WA Landmark Egyptian Theater in 1999. However, this print was the one-of-a-kind 70mm blow-up, directly from the Warner Bros. vault. In 2007, the workprint was made available to the public for the first time on disc 5 of the 5-disc Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD/HD-DVD/Blu-ray Disc of the film (which also contains the US theatrical cut, the European cut, the Director's Cut and the Final Cut). The differences between the workprint and the other versions include: - The logo for the Ladd Company is on a white background, not a black background. - The title screen for the film is different, with the words 'BLADE RUNNER' sliding onto the screen accompanied by the sound of knives. - New American Dictionary (2016) definition of a replicant is used in lieu of the opening credit crawl. - The opening shots do not include the close-up and subsequent pull-away from the eye seen in all other cuts, it simply cuts closer and closer to the Tyrell building. Additionally, the shot moving into towards the window is absent, as are two interior wide shots of Holden standing at the window. Throughout the scene, air-traffic control headings can be heard. - After Leon shoots Holden and he crashes through the wall, hitting the table, the shot stays on Holden as fan blades brush his hair and his back smokes from the gunfire. - Deckard's meal at \"The White Dragon\" can be seen being laid on the bar in front of him, rather than merely being heard. Additionally, the shot of Deckard rubbing his chopsticks together is longer. Also, as Gaff speaks to Deckard, the shot remains on Deckard rather than cutting to Gaff, showing Deckard having some difficulty eating his noodles. - As Deckard and Gaff are flying to the police station, in all versions of the film, you can see Gaff speaking to Deckard, but in the Workprint you can actually hear what he says. - During the briefing, the shot of Bryant getting a bottle and pouring two drinks is absent. Also missing is Bryant's line \"I need the old Blade Runner, I need your magic.\" - Bryant says \"two\" replicants were fried running through an electric field instead of one.\" - When looking at the incept tapes, Bryant comments on Leon's ability to work all day and night. - As Gaff and Deckard approach the Tyrell building, there is more air traffic control heard. - When Rachael asks Deckard if she can ask him a personal question, Deckard responds \"Sure. What is it?\" In all other versions of the film, he simply says \"Sure.\" - When Deckard and Gaff inspect Leon's address and the attendant opens the room for them, he mutters \"Kowalski\". - After Chew tells Roy that J.F. Sebastian will take him to Tyrell, the shot where Roy leans forward and says, \"Now, where will we find this J.F. Sebastian?\" is missing. - After Rachael has left Deckard's apartment, and he walks out onto the balcony, there is the sound of a police siren, which is absent in all other cuts. - When Deckard plays the piano in a depressed stupor: a) there is no unicorn vision, b) there is no background music, and c) we hear one or two notes Harrison Ford actually played on the set. - A whirring sound comes from the Esper that is absent in all other versions. - After zooming in on the shot of Roy in the photo, Deckard can be heard to say \"Hello Roy.\" Then, after printing the hardcopy, he says \"Zhora or Pris?\" - When Deckard gives the snake scale to the Cambodian lady, she says \"It will take a moment.\" - Deckard's search for Abdul Hassan lasts longer: we see more of Animoid Row and the back streets of the sector. As Deckard moves away from the Cambodian lady, there is an eighteen second crane shot showing Deckard disappearing into the crowd. - The dialogue heard during the scene with Hassan matches perfectly with the lip movements. - As Deckard nears Taffy Lewis' club, there is a twelve second crane shot showing the geography of the street. - There is a shot of two dancers in hockey masks outside Taffy's bar. - There is a shot of Deckard asking for directions to Taffy Lewis' from a uniformed policeman. - The audio-only introduction of 'Miss Salome' is slightly different. - There is a close-up shot of Deckard examining a sequin from Zhora's costume. - After Zhora attacks Deckard and flees, we see Deckard loosen his tie from his throat. - \"If I Didn't Care\" by the Ink Spots, is in the background when Deckard purchases a bottle of Tsing Tao, instead of \"One More Kiss, Dear.\" - After Rachael shoots Leon, the shot of him falling forward onto Deckard is absent, as is the shot of Rachael lowering the gun and stepping forward. - In Deckard's apartment, there is no \"Love Theme\"; the initial music track merely continues on longer. Also, Rachel plays a different selection on the piano when testing herself, and the shot of her undoing her hair and letting it floor to her shoulders is missing. - Roy says to Tyrell, \"I want more life, father\". - When Roy kills Tyrell, the footage is the same as in the International version, showing Roy's thumbs going into Tyrell's eyes and blood spurting out. Additionally, when Roy turns to Sebastian, he says \"I'm sorry, Sebastian. Come. Come\", as he walks towards him. As Sebastian turns to run, he can be heard whimpering. - Bryant's info to Deckard over the CB about Tyrell's and Sebastian's deaths are heard as we see Deckard driving through the tunnel. When Deckard is parked in his sedan on the street, he is merely preparing to call J.F.'s apartment before the police spinner interrogates him. Also, when the spinner arrives, we hear police sirens. - During the fight between, Pris and Deckard, we see Pris lift him up by the nostrils. - When Deckard shoots Pris, he shoots 3 times instead of 2. - There is the sound of a thunderclap as Roy examines Pris' body. - We actually see Roy break Deckard's fingers, in a split second close up, with a prop-hand. Also, the shot when Deckard pops his fingers back in is taken from a different angle, and Deckard's scream is much quieter than in all other versions of the film. - There are more shots of Roy running through the Bradbury. - When Roy pushes his head through the wall, there is an extra line; \"You're not in pain are you? Are you in pain?\" - There are more shots of Deckard as he climbs to the roof, and also more shots of him as he hangs on to the neighboring building. - The music during the chase is completely different from the music of Vangelis (according to 'Paul Sammon' (qv), the music used is from old soundtracks by 'James Horner' (qv) and 'Jerry Goldsmith' (qv)). - Different, farther-away shots of Roy as Deckard watches him die. Additionally, there is an alternate narration (the only narration in this version): \"I watched him die all night. It was a long, slow thing and he fought it all the way. He never whimpered and he never quit. He took all the time he had as though he loved life very much. Every second of it...even the pain. Then, he was dead.\" - Deckard's movement through his apartment as he searches for Rachael is different, with a wide shot of him scanning the room. The overall scene is approximately 20 seconds shorter than in all other versions - The shot of Deckard telling Rachael to wait before leaving the apartment is missing. - There is no happy ending, the film ends when the elevator doors slam. - There are no end credits, merely exit music for about a minute: the same cue heard as when Gaff takes Deckard to see Bryant at the start of the movie.",

The scene in the train station, where Monty meets Harold is absent, as well as the loading of the baggage in the taxi they share. We simply see Monty writing a letter to his parents, mentioning that \"Harold is as intense as ever\" (cut to the cricket scene, maybe 30 seconds long), and then continues with \"I remember our first day... we shared a taxi together\" (cut to the two students unloading their stuff from the car). This alternate version also have slightly different end credits, and does not mention Harold marrying Sybil. The differences are minor (the U.S. version provides a more shocking memento of WWI, when it shows crippled baggage handlers in the station); one of the reasons the cricket scene was dropped in favour  of the station one was due to the distributor's worry that the American  market would not understand it.",

The new scene was a low-angle shot of the monolith, done in order to portray and clarify the connection between the man-ape using the tool and the monolith. - Some shots of Frank Poole jogging in the centrifuge were removed. - An entire sequence of several shots in which Dave Bowman searches for the replacement antenna part in storage was removed. - A scene where HAL severs radio communication between the \"Discovery\" and Poole's pod before killing him was removed. This scene explains a line that stayed in the film in which Bowman addresses HAL on the subject. - Some shots of Poole's space walk before he is killed were removed.",

The R-rated U.S. theatrical version runs 100m 13s, with numerous MPAA-imposed cuts for sexual content/dialogue and a couple New World Pictures-imposed ones for unknown reasons. - 16s of candid opening dialogue are trimmed in the R-rated version. After one of the group members tells Donny Hopper (Bruce Davison), \"Fuck you, Hopper,\" the following lines present in the unrated version are all removed -- Donny: \"I do. Every night. Me and my jar of Vaseline. I can fuck any woman I want and I don't even have to make her come.\" Female group member: \"Really? Well, I'd rather get fucked by a vibrator than your cock any day. It's honest, loving, and I don't have to make breakfast for it in the morning.\" The dirty Adam and Eve joke in Donny's monologue that survives in the R-rated version is pushed up further than it appears in the unrated version, while the main titles are slowed down. - In the scene where China Blue (Kathleen Turner) explains to Carl (John G. Scanlon) how she plays the flute and then gives him a blow job, the R-rated version shows it in one long take using alternate footage, with the camera never losing sight of his face as she goes down on him. The unrated version cuts away from him to show two close-up shots of her face next to his crotch, unzipping his bulging jeans and caressing the fly with her hand. These are bookended by an insert shot of an erotic, B&W line drawing, showing in triplicate, a Japanese woman giving a blow job to a Japanese man (who possesses one gargantuan erect penis and testicles). The unrated version of the scene runs 14s longer, because Turner says her lines more slowly. - The beginning of the China Blue/Carl aftermath scene uses alternate take footage in the R-rated version, up through the shot of China making a gargle and answering \"Miss Liberty.\" Carl's orgasm is over as he says \"fucking incredible\" once -- while in the unrated version, he's still having one as he says it twice -- and when he asks China her name, the camera again focuses on him in one long take. In the unrated version, shots of Carl alternate with four shots of China Blue bent down (with very smudged lipstick, as she wipes her mouth) and one shot of her hand turning off the radio. The R-rated version of this runs 14s longer again, mostly because both actors say their lines more slowly. - The scene where China Blue's second trick (Pat McNamara) rapes her has been truncated in the R-rated version. It cuts to Reverend Shayne standing outside after one sexual thrust, while the unrated cuts to it after sixteen more thrusts (intercut with five different erotic, color drawings of Japanese men and women engaged in you-know-what) and is 16s longer. - An additional 2 thrusts, totalling 2s, have been trimmed from the overhead shot of China Blue's second trick finishing the deed in the R-rated version. The unrated version has music over it, while U.S. theatrical prints have none. - In the unrated version, China Blue calls trick #2 \"sweetdick,\" a phrase which he then repeats. The R-rated version overdubs both utterances of the word with \"sweetheart.\" - When Reverend Shayne first gets in to see China Blue and tells her he's there to save her, she replies, \"Why don't you fuck me, that'll save me\" in the unrated version. The R-rated version overdubs the word \"fuck\" with \"fix.\" - China Blue goes on to tell Reverend Shayne that she's \"Fit as a fiddle and ready for cock\" in the unrated version. The R-rated version overdubs the word \"cock\" with \"love.\" - The R-rated version of the scene where Bobby Grady (John Laughlin) breaks into China Blue's apartment loses 21s of him turning on a wall-mounted TV and her VCR, which plays a porno tape of a man and woman having anal sex. - 50s are cut from the R-rated version after Bobby unzips the red panties in China Blue's drawer. The unrated version goes on to show him pulling out a book and opening it up to reveal the same kind of erotic Japanese drawings that were seen during China Blue's rape. Bobby turns the pages, stands up, and confusingly looks back and forth at the TV -- which now shows the man having a threesome with two women and cultimating in one of them -- and the book, before he has a revelation. Later in the film, when Bobby pays his first visit to Joanna's (Kathleen Turner) apartment, he comments on a similar, albeit somewhat less graphic, piece of artwork hanging on her wall, saying that he \"saw these a book once.\" This is left in the R-rated cut, so viewers who've only seen that version won't know where it was he saw it and what book he's talking about. - The R-rated version of the shot where China Blue undresses Bobby as they're about to first have sex has 7s trimmed of her unzipping his jeans and starting to remove them. - 1m 32s have been deleted from China Blue's and Bobby's first sex scene in the R-rated version -- 15s of them continuing to make out, the remaining 1m 17s of them doing the nasty in silhouette as he demonstrates all the new positions he just learned about in her book. - A 2m 37s scene of Bobby and Amy (Annie Potts) having a fight in front of Jimmy and Lisa (Seth Wagerman, Christina Lange) during breakfast was removed from the U.S. theatrical version by New World Pictures, possibly because Amy is extremely unpleasant in it. Bobby gets annoyed at her for pouring maple syrup, which he doesn't like, on his pancakes, she gets annoyed at him for noticing a week after the fact that she got her hair done, and she needles him by insinuating to the kids that he's stupid and useless because he can't plant a garden and doesn't know what strontium 90 means. He finally has enough of her cutting him down, and leaves for work in a huff. This scene appears in the film after the one where Reverend Shayne knocks Bobby down and Bobby and China Blue make amends. - New World Pictures broke the Grady family barbecue into two scenes in the U.S. theatrical cut. In that version, they bookend the scenes of China Blue being picked up by Arthur and Claudia (John Rose, Louise Sorel) in a limo and Reverend Shayne stabbing the blow-up doll. In the directors cut, the barbecue appears in its entirety immediately after that scene. - The unrated version contains a 3m 38s sequence of China Blue putting on her wig and makeup, picking up a handsome, corrupt cop (Randall Brady) on the streets, taking him back to her place, handcuffing him to her bed while wearing a leather S&M getup, having rough sex with him -- which causes his wrists to get cut up by the cuffs and his legs to get cut up by her high heels -- and grinding his nightstick into his stomach before sodomizing him with it, as Reverend Shayne watches the entire thing from behind his peephole, stroking his missile vibrator up and down. All of this is intercut with one erotic B&W Japanese line drawing -- similar to the one shown during Carl's blow job -- and three blood red-tinted photographs showing policemen in the line of duty. Afterwards, Reverend Shayne lies down and goes to sleep, and she uncuffs the cop and asks if he'd like to take a shower there, as she's got Ivory soap which is 99 44/100% pure (repeating what Bobby said after their first time), but he just spits on her in disgust, and she washes her face off in the sink (echoing what Bobby did after their first time), crying, after he's left. The MPAA refused to give the film an \"R\" unless this entire scene was removed. However, the shot which follows this -- of China Blue putting on her makeup in the mirror, still crying -- remains in the R-rated version, making it unclear exactly what she's upset about. - New World Pictures removed 2m 17s from the scene where Amy goes down to Grady's electronics store to try to rekindle with Bobby, again presumably because Amy is extremely unsympathetic. The theatrical cut of it ends when she tells him, \"All I want is my husband.\" The director's cut continues with her saying that the kids need a father to teach them responsibility, and him telling her he doubts it'll do them any good with the two of them playing a charade in front of them. He lets her know he doesn't want to get back together, and she correctly figures out that he's met someone else, as she can \"smell her all over\" him. She then returns to her old ways, and starts nagging him about the other woman. After he admits in stride that he's having an affair, she warns him to remember his family and make a choice.",

        "Following attacks from politicians on violent films aimed at children, Warner Brothers. pushed the release date back and recut the film to a tamer version, toning down some of the violence in the original cut sent out in screener tapes. On April 23, 2001, the unedited version of the film was released in the US exclusively on DVD. Up until that point the uncut version had only been released as screeners that were sent out before the changes were made. The following are scenes that were changed in the edited-for-content version: - Lots of white flashes have been added to the action sequences where there were previously none. Additionally, combinations of punches have been mostly trimmed down to one punch. For example, Woof slashes the guard once now instead of twice. Batman no longer punches Ghoul in the gut, he just uppercuts him into the dish. Later on in the club, Terry's vicious attack on Ghoul is cut to a flash and Terry running away while Ghoul falls. There is a 360-degree fight sequence in the opening battle that has also been removed, where Batman fends off the Jokerz one by one. - Seat belts added to Terry and Bruce as the drive home after their first meeting with the new Joker. - Bonk is not shot, but given a lethal dose of laughing gas, and he dies off screen. Because of this the whole \"Take the trash outside, Dee Dee\" and \"Are you with me?\" sequence is cut. - When Bruce throws the batarang it appears as though he's pleased he can still throw & catch a batarang instead of it showing him using it to decapitate a Two Face dummy. - When Terry enters the Batcave to find it demolished by the Joker, the letter's 'HA! HA!' written across the floor are changed from red to purple. Probably to assure us it is not written on Bruce's blood. - All other blood is removed. (Only one example was passed over. In the flashback sequence when Batman smashes through the projection he smacks the Joker. Blots of blood fly from the Jokers mouth, but he is not bleeding in the next shot.) - In the unedited version, when Batman (in the present) frees himself from the Jokers' ribbon wrap, he throws the knife that he used to free himself with at the Joker. The Joker ducks at the last second and the blade goes through the stage curtain. This would explain the hole behind the Joker. - The Joker is not shot, but slips in some water and is electrocuted off screen. Plus, they don't mention they buried him deep under Arkham or any of that. The dialogue is completely changed in that sequence. - Barbara says that Leslie Thompkins helped Tim Drake \"regain himself\" instead of \"regain his sanity.\" (or something along those lines) - During a montage where Batman and Batgirl comb \"the underworld\" looking for clues about Robin's disappearance, Batgirl talks to a nicely-dressed man and woman instead of two sleazily-dressed women (who are pretty obviously hookers) on a street corner. - Also, Joker no longer slices Batman across the chest of in the leg, and any blood is digitally removed. Joker just punches Batman. - More than half of the \"Our Family Memories\" is cut out, only showing Robin tied up and struggling, and cutting the scene where Joker opens the barbeque lids, picks up the voltage tongs, and shocks the Boy. - A lot of dialogue is changed as well. And reference to the word \"kill\" is changed. - The opening fight seqeunce is trimmed, cutting out a second Dee-Dee kick and completely redoing that entire Batman/Dee Dee sequence. - The club fight is changed. The pink clown no longer punches Terry and says \"I don't know why the boss wants a dreg like you outta the way, but as long as it's fun...\". He just goes for his gun and says \"Slag him!\". - Bruce says \"Robin defeated him.\" instead of \"Robin did kill him\". Joker says \"Bat-Kook\" instead of \"Bat-Fart\". Jordan Price says \"Ice\" instead of \"kill\". Tim Drake says \"I can still hear his scream\" instead of \"I can still hear the shot\". Joker says \"...with such yutzes\" instead of \"...with such putzes\". - In the scene where the satellite laser chases the Batmoblie it blasts an unmarked, dark, seemingly empty building. Originally it was a lit movie theater. (In the edited version the word 'cineplex' can be seen exploding out of the wreckage in the last few frames of the shot.) - The clothing on 'Nanna Harley' is changed from blue and purple to Harley Quinn's trademark red and black.",

The other ending, however, is far different in that Carl Scott first runs into Ku Feng's character and the two of them fight first. Soon after, Bruce arrives and finds Carl tied to a tree still alive, rather than hanging dead from an overhanging branch. Aside from this, Feng's death is far more graphic showing a pseudo-X-Ray shot of Bruce's index finger buried into Feng's heart. Bruce then pulls his finger out, causing the heart to squirt out blood and then finally finishes off Feng with two fingers stabbing his throat, and Feng spitting out blood.

Wat and Roland say there should be three phoenixes, since there's three of them. - Lord Adhemar's original introduction scene, where he slaps around one of his servants while having his armor fitted, and reference is made to the \"triple phoenix\" design of Sir Ulrich's crest. - Chaucer giving another substantial introduction for Sir Ulrich, similar to the first one, right before his match with Lord Adhemar. He berates Adhemar's herald before the speech; after the speech, Adhemar's herald appears impressed, which leads to his imitation of Chaucer's style later in the film. - When Adhemar leaves the dance, we find out the reason for his pained expression; in a deleted scene, he reveals to a monk that he is tone-deaf, and has never been able to hear music as anything more than noise. Adhemar then strides out into the midst of the poor, waiting outside the castle for handouts, and starts a riot by throwing food and money into the crowd. - Another deleted scene has Will, Roland, Wat, and Kate seeing Chaucer walking back to their quarters naked again. They follow him, but it turns that he was fetching food for his wife, Phillipa (who is also naked), and had not lost his clothes gambling like they thought. They leave, laughing, and run into Jocelyn and Christiana. Christiana and Roland leave together (with a suggestion of romance), William and Jocelyn leave together, but when Wat holds out his hand for Kate, she just hands him a pastry and walks off. Wat says \"Hey, Beautiful\" to the pastry and walks off happy anyway. - The original version of the scene with William in the stocks is considerably longer, and has an extensive speech by Chaucer (which is probably his best in the film). Rather than having the crowd calmed by the appearance of Prince Edward, the crowd is converted by Chaucer's speech, and has already begun chanting \"William, William!\" by the time the Prince reveals himself.

The French DVD includes both versions (via seamless branching), while the U.S. Criterion DVD features the cut footage as an extra. The PAL releases run 97 minutes. This shorter version makes the following changes: - An early scene in which Sada has sex with Ishida while playing a shamisen has been cut by about a minute and a half. In the original version, Sada seemingly goes unconscious and Ishida checks for her heartbeat. - A brief shot (12 seconds) of Ishida and Sada on a bridge has been added to the scene in which the couple goes out walking at night. - A later scene (in which the geishas assault one of their own with a dildo) is cut by 14 seconds to remove a shot of Ishida and Sada's faces in mid-copulation. - An entire two-minute scene is deleted about an hour into the film. This scene features Sada and Ishida having sex behind a thin screen, while Ishida speaks of the \"darkness\" he feels inside Sada. - The scene in which Sada first strangles Ishida is cut by just over one minute. In the short version, the scene ends when Ishida starts coughing and Sada releases his throat. In the original version, Ishida asks her to resume, which she does (only to stop when he begins coughing again). - The scene in which Ishida becomes drowsy while having sex with Sada is edited differently. The original version has slightly different dialogue and has an additional minute of footage where Ishida actually does fall asleep for a short time. - The scene in which Sada wakes up after her final night with Ishida is cut by one minute. The original version shows Sada lying on the floor and apparently panicking, walking around the room and opening doors for no obvious reason.

        "A 113 minute 70mm workprint was shown at the some sneak previews in Dallas and Denver in 1982. The film scored extremely poorly from the test audiences, and it was this poor reaction which led to the happy ending and the voice-over narration. In 1989, sound preservationist 'Michael Arick' (qv) came across a 70mm print of Blade Runner in the TODD-AO vaults. Thinking it was the International Cut, Arick purchased the print for Warners, who loaned it out to the Los Angeles Cineplex-Odeon Fairfax Theatre in 1990 for a festival of 70mm prints. It was at this screening that people realized they were watching the Dallas/Denver Workprint. The film was subsequently screened at UCLA's Los Angeles Perspectives Multimedia Festival in 1991. A 35mm reduction of this version was later shown at the NuArt Theatre and the Art Deco Castro Theater in San Francisco in 1991. It was the success of these four screenings that prompted Warner Bros. to look into the possibility of releasing a Director's Cut of the film. The workprint briefly resurfaced again, by accident, for a one-week engagement (1/15 - 1/21) at the Seattle, WA Landmark Egyptian Theater in 1999. However, this print was the one-of-a-kind 70mm blow-up, directly from the Warner Bros. vault. In 2007, the workprint was made available to the public for the first time on disc 5 of the 5-disc Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD/HD-DVD/Blu-ray Disc of the film (which also contains the US theatrical cut, the European cut, the Director's Cut and the Final Cut). The differences between the workprint and the other versions include: - The logo for the Ladd Company is on a white background, not a black background. - The title screen for the film is different, with the words 'BLADE RUNNER' sliding onto the screen accompanied by the sound of knives. - New American Dictionary (2016) definition of a replicant is used in lieu of the opening credit crawl. - The opening shots do not include the close-up and subsequent pull-away from the eye seen in all other cuts, it simply cuts closer and closer to the Tyrell building. Additionally, the shot moving into towards the window is absent, as are two interior wide shots of Holden standing at the window. Throughout the scene, air-traffic control headings can be heard. - After Leon shoots Holden and he crashes through the wall, hitting the table, the shot stays on Holden as fan blades brush his hair and his back smokes from the gunfire. - Deckard's meal at \"The White Dragon\" can be seen being laid on the bar in front of him, rather than merely being heard. Additionally, the shot of Deckard rubbing his chopsticks together is longer. Also, as Gaff speaks to Deckard, the shot remains on Deckard rather than cutting to Gaff, showing Deckard having some difficulty eating his noodles. - As Deckard and Gaff are flying to the police station, in all versions of the film, you can see Gaff speaking to Deckard, but in the Workprint you can actually hear what he says. - During the briefing, the shot of Bryant getting a bottle and pouring two drinks is absent. Also missing is Bryant's line \"I need the old Blade Runner, I need your magic.\" - Bryant says \"two\" replicants were fried running through an electric field instead of one.\" - When looking at the incept tapes, Bryant comments on Leon's ability to work all day and night. - As Gaff and Deckard approach the Tyrell building, there is more air traffic control heard. - When Rachael asks Deckard if she can ask him a personal question, Deckard responds \"Sure. What is it?\" In all other versions of the film, he simply says \"Sure.\" - When Deckard and Gaff inspect Leon's address and the attendant opens the room for them, he mutters \"Kowalski\". - After Chew tells Roy that J.F. Sebastian will take him to Tyrell, the shot where Roy leans forward and says, \"Now, where will we find this J.F. Sebastian?\" is missing. - After Rachael has left Deckard's apartment, and he walks out onto the balcony, there is the sound of a police siren, which is absent in all other cuts. - When Deckard plays the piano in a depressed stupor: a) there is no unicorn vision, b) there is no background music, and c) we hear one or two notes Harrison Ford actually played on the set. - A whirring sound comes from the Esper that is absent in all other versions. - After zooming in on the shot of Roy in the photo, Deckard can be heard to say \"Hello Roy.\" Then, after printing the hardcopy, he says \"Zhora or Pris?\" - When Deckard gives the snake scale to the Cambodian lady, she says \"It will take a moment.\" - Deckard's search for Abdul Hassan lasts longer: we see more of Animoid Row and the back streets of the sector. As Deckard moves away from the Cambodian lady, there is an eighteen second crane shot showing Deckard disappearing into the crowd. - The dialogue heard during the scene with Hassan matches perfectly with the lip movements. - As Deckard nears Taffy Lewis' club, there is a twelve second crane shot showing the geography of the street. - There is a shot of two dancers in hockey masks outside Taffy's bar. - There is a shot of Deckard asking for directions to Taffy Lewis' from a uniformed policeman. - The audio-only introduction of 'Miss Salome' is slightly different. - There is a close-up shot of Deckard examining a sequin from Zhora's costume. - After Zhora attacks Deckard and flees, we see Deckard loosen his tie from his throat. - \"If I Didn't Care\" by the Ink Spots, is in the background when Deckard purchases a bottle of Tsing Tao, instead of \"One More Kiss, Dear.\" - After Rachael shoots Leon, the shot of him falling forward onto Deckard is absent, as is the shot of Rachael lowering the gun and stepping forward. - In Deckard's apartment, there is no \"Love Theme\"; the initial music track merely continues on longer. Also, Rachel plays a different selection on the piano when testing herself, and the shot of her undoing her hair and letting it floor to her shoulders is missing. - Roy says to Tyrell, \"I want more life, father\". - When Roy kills Tyrell, the footage is the same as in the International version, showing Roy's thumbs going into Tyrell's eyes and blood spurting out. Additionally, when Roy turns to Sebastian, he says \"I'm sorry, Sebastian. Come. Come\", as he walks towards him. As Sebastian turns to run, he can be heard whimpering. - Bryant's info to Deckard over the CB about Tyrell's and Sebastian's deaths are heard as we see Deckard driving through the tunnel. When Deckard is parked in his sedan on the street, he is merely preparing to call J.F.'s apartment before the police spinner interrogates him. Also, when the spinner arrives, we hear police sirens. - During the fight between, Pris and Deckard, we see Pris lift him up by the nostrils. - When Deckard shoots Pris, he shoots 3 times instead of 2. - There is the sound of a thunderclap as Roy examines Pris' body. - We actually see Roy break Deckard's fingers, in a split second close up, with a prop-hand. Also, the shot when Deckard pops his fingers back in is taken from a different angle, and Deckard's scream is much quieter than in all other versions of the film. - There are more shots of Roy running through the Bradbury. - When Roy pushes his head through the wall, there is an extra line; \"You're not in pain are you? Are you in pain?\" - There are more shots of Deckard as he climbs to the roof, and also more shots of him as he hangs on to the neighboring building. - The music during the chase is completely different from the music of Vangelis (according to 'Paul Sammon' (qv), the music used is from old soundtracks by 'James Horner' (qv) and 'Jerry Goldsmith' (qv)). - Different, farther-away shots of Roy as Deckard watches him die. Additionally, there is an alternate narration (the only narration in this version): \"I watched him die all night. It was a long, slow thing and he fought it all the way. He never whimpered and he never quit. He took all the time he had as though he loved life very much. Every second of it...even the pain. Then, he was dead.\" - Deckard's movement through his apartment as he searches for Rachael is different, with a wide shot of him scanning the room. The overall scene is approximately 20 seconds shorter than in all other versions - The shot of Deckard telling Rachael to wait before leaving the apartment is missing. - There is no happy ending, the film ends when the elevator doors slam. - There are no end credits, merely exit music for about a minute: the same cue heard as when Gaff takes Deckard to see Bryant at the start of the movie.",

There are several differences between it and the tv series: - 'Trini' was played by a different actress, Audri Dubois, and was completely different personality (and nationality) wise to the 'Trini Kwan' in the TV series played by Thuy Trang. - 'Zordon' was named 'Zoltar' and the image of his head in a tube was also blurred and somewhat pulsating. - There was no Juice bar (and hence no Ernie). Instead the Earth based scene took place in a bowling alley. - The Command Center's interior had different control panels and lighting. - The plating on Alpha 5's upper torso was notably larger and didn't have the familiar \"lightning bolt\" logo. - 'Flyguy', renamed 'King Sphinx' for his eventual appearance in the TV series, appeared in the episode to battle the rangers with 'Goldar'. -The Dinozords were known as Dinodroids'. - There was a Bulk character, but no Skull character. Instead there were three other bullies/punks alongside Bulk.",

        "SPOILER: The original British Thorn EMI VHS release, when compared to the 2005 Mosaic DVD appears to have many scenes that were not merely edited for censorship but were different takes used in a 'tamer' version. Most obvious is the scene where Patsy introduces Sally to the gang as a potential prostitute. In the original Thorn EMI release she remains fully clothed throughout and when Fallon is asked if he wants to 'check out this piece of merchandise' him and Sally simply walk off screen. In the 2005 DVD Sally undresses in front of the gang at Patsy's insistence and is naked when Fallon approaches her. Another scene that was a different take is when Norris kills Fallon in the woodwork lab. In the Thorn EMI release he simply pushes Fallon back over the saw blade killing him almost instantly. In the 2005 DVD he cuts off Fallon's right arm first, Fallon then staggers upright and THEN Norris pushes him back on the blade. Other scenes cut completely and now reinstated are: - The entire fight with Joo Joo's gang. - The rape scene - Barnyard, Patsy and Drugstore finding Fallon's body - Drugstore's death scene (more close ups of his body) - Norris hitting Barnyard more times on the head with the pipe. - Stegman cutting Diane's breasts before fighting Norris. Also the 2005 DVD has written prologue and epilogue. The prologue states the amount of attacks on staff in US High Schools and states that 'no high school is as bad as Lincoln High....yet'. The epilogue states that 'Andy Norris was never prosecuted as the police couldn't find anyone who actually saw it.",

This creates problems with aural continuity, because halfway through season one, Paul Fusco changed Alf's voice from being deep and raspy to a higher, friendlier-sounding pitch; therefore, Alf's voice in the flashbacks doesn't quite match his voice in the new footage. This version appears on the Region 2 DVD. - Syndicated version - Removes several scenes (including a subplot with Judy Landers) to make room for extra commercials, and the flashback audio is partially re-recorded with the \"new\" Alf voice. - Region 1 DVD version - A bizarre hybrid which uses the re-dubbed flashbacks and restores the footage deleted from the original broadcast... BUT deletes several instances of characters singing or lip-syncing to popular songs, presumably due to licensing issues.",

Footage includes facial explosions and several scientists exploding at the gut in lingering slow-motion. - 19 seconds cut from warehouse sequence showing criminals exploding at the gut after unwisely standing amongst alien pods. - 2 seconds cut from warehouse sequence in which remains of freshly-exploded men are shown. - 9 seconds cut from climax, in which man's head is devoured by queen alien. - 11 seconds cut from climax showing a scientist exploding at the gut after being shot by Ian McCulloch. - 33 seconds cut from climax showing chief villain's chest exploding in slow-motion viscera-launch spectacle.
