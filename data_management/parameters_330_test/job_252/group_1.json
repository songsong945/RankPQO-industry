The girls start to wonder if Raye is dumping them and getting a new best friend. In Japanese, Minako suggests that Rei may be on a date with the girl! Usagi can't believe it but Minako points that it could be just like Haruka and Michiru. Then Mako (Lita) wonders if the girl might really be a man dressed as a woman! Raye agrees to help Maya with her problem, but in Japanese it's actually the reverse - Maya agrees to help Raye by performing at the festival. Later, Raye talks about how she is helping Maya overcome her nerves. In Japanese, Rei talks about how hard Maya works and begins to feel some despair about how hard one needs to work to be successful. In the end, she and Serena agree to just do their best.
