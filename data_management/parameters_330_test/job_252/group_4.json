Most significant cuts include: - graphic sexual activity during the climactic orgy sequence; - The death of a character named Annette The originally scripted scene showed her having her throat slowly pushed onto a pane of glass. The scene was filmed and very brutal, done all in one graphic cut.  However, she shot was later replaced with her character's head split open in the front door. That scene was still trimmed heavily. In unrated versions the top of her head erupts and a splash of blood flies across the doorjamb. - Rod's death had more blood. - Timmy's death was an on screen kill that featured gruesome spurting blood. - A character's death at the climatic orgy was nixed for time and MPAA constraints. A male character's throat was slashed open.",
