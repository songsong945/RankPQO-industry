        "A preliminary edit of the first episode, \"Arrival\", was broadcast by accident on one PBS station in the 1970s. Although the original negative of this edit has been lost, a videotape copy was discovered and released on DVD in 2002. Among the major differences from the officially broadcast version: - Different theme music and differently edited opening credits (same as the alternate version of \"Chimes of Big Ben.\") - Slight differences in the sequence where No. 6 wakes up in the Village for the first time. - A longer version of the sequence where No. 6 tours The Village by taxi. - When Rover is introduced, it does not kill a villager as it does in the televised version. - Longer version of the sequence where No. 6's radio-controlled helicopter returns to the Village. - Different closing credits, ending with an image of Earth and the universe turning into the pennyfarthing bicycle logo. Also, Wilfred Josephs is credited as musical director.",
