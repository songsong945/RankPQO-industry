Interesting what they chose to remove, considering that much of the animation itself could be seen by some as rather risqu\u00e9 and probably intended for an adult audience. The removed bits generally are those containing abuse by the conductor upon the orchestra and animator. This is the version that was theatrically released in the U.S..
