The new version contained approximately 31 seconds of replacement, less lascivious footage for two scenes: the high speed (2 fps) orgy in Alex's bedroom, and the Ludovico rape scene. The bedroom scene was made more comical by having one of the girls fall off the bed and Alex joins her down there. The Ludovico rape scene was altered in that the scenes with the first two droogs was from the side and waist-up, so it is less explicit. The third droog was removed completely and replaced with a close-up of one of the doctor's face as they are watching Alex's treatment.",
