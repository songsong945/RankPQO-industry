They run into some Born-again Christians having a baptism/picnic and join in. - Lily Von Shtupp (Madeline Kahn) gives a brief spoken introduction to the saloon crowd before beginning her song. - Governor Le Petomaine (Mel Brooks) arrives in the fake Rock Ridge a few moments before the final showdown, in a stagecoach with a flashing red light on the back, makes a joke about losing the \"blue collar vote\" and does a skit in the town where he impersonates Harpo Marx. - When the dynamite fails to explode, Lily Von Schtuup says with some German rambling that it didn't work.
