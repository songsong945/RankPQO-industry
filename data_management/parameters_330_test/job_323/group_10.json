Police show up soon enough and trap Wadsworth, but not for long. He gets away from the chief and leaves, locking all the people in the mansion. But as he steals a police car, he notices a 'smell' (the dog dropping smell from the beginning of the film) and realizes the Doberman from earlier is now in the police car, and it lunges for him. The police car crashes, and Wadsworth is dead. This implies that the others got out okay now that the windows were not guarded by the Doberman any longer.",

Note:These scenes are found in old Croatian bootleg VHS of the movie,so it might be hard to for the viewer to properly translate what he has seen. 1.Alternate dialogue for opening hostage scene: TV Cut - \"You lookin at the brave hunter!\" DVD Uncut - \"You lookin at the fuckin hunter!\" 2.Extra few seconds dialogue scene during the Cobra's argument with low rider.Cobra turns around and says something like: \"Don't dirt America,keep it clean.\" 3.Extra scene after the first Nightslasher murder in which young Asian kid brings box in police station.While kid is playing with some toys,one of the cops takes the box and sees blood dripping from bottom.Then he receives a phone call in which Nightslasher says something like: \"Her hands are with you.Her soul is in another world\" Cop tells some other cop to trace the call and scene cuts to the regular autopsy scene. 4.Extra scene during the \"Angel Of The City\" montage in which Nightslasher is working in some factory cutting fish plus small scene (if i remember correctly) in which one of the gang members (one with the sniper at final shootout) is cutting some telephone wires. Same guy has one more scene after the attack on Cobra's place where he escapes in his car after seeing gang member falling from stairs after Cobra shoots him. 5.Some US TV versions are said to include a scene before big car chase,in which Nightslasher's car is getting fixed for the attack on Ingrid and Cobra,and extra dialogue scene with Cobra and his police chief after the chase,but this is not found in bootleg VHS. 6.Extra dialogue scene during road trip when song \"Feel The Heat\" is playing.In this scene Cobra and Ingrid are talking about football and at the end Cobra Says some funny line about his looks,something like: \"Have you seen my legs?\" 7.Extra scene between Stalk and Cobra's partner Chico where he asks her will she \"sexually assault him after all this is finished.\" 8.Small extra scene when Cobra and Ingrid are together in motel while some old guy looks at motel from his house and then pulls the curtain. 9.Extended,more violent version of the town attack during the final showdown in which same old guy is strangled with wire,and i think that some other people were killed. 10.Alternate,cut death scenes of sniper gang member and Nightslasher. Parts where both of them are set on fire were cut. 11.Extra scene after the shootout.Cobra and Ingrid are walking out of the factory when three cops shows up and point shotguns at them.Cobra then says: \"You guys missed the hell of a party.\"",
