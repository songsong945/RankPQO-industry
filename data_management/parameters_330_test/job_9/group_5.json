The second one is used on FOX, Kids WB, and in syndication, which is the current one they used in the United States, it features newer animation, for example, Beetlejuice rises from the grave and as a corpse. The third one is used when FOX re-ran Beetlejuice, this one re-edits clips from the second introduction and clips from various episodes."

However, it cuts out many scenes for the original 2001 airing, including Dave witnessing his father's death in a hospital, a comical scene about the band members being chased by farmers with pitchforks, and all mentions of the So Far So Good So What album and Cliff Burton's death."

These new versions add in details that have happened to the bands since the original segments on the bands aired. However, these are a double-edged sword, in that a good deal of the material previously present in the episode has been cut out to maintain the hour-long time slot."

The A&E Home Video version, released in 1996, contained several extra minutes of footage that was trimmed from the program prior to broadcast. The 10th anniversary edition of this documentary, Produced by Laughsmith Entertainment and distributed by Mackinac Media in 2005, was significantly revised and updated. This version contains additional footage not seen in either the original television broadcast or the first A&E Home Video release."

This opening was replaced by a standardized opening for syndication. The DVD release of season 1 uses the syndicated version of the opening credits."
