        "In Tokyopop's American DVD release, there are two versions of the show. One is the original ('Import Version'). One is a new version ('Tricked-Out Version') which has an english dub and various other changes such as: - Japanese character names dropped in exchange for more English sounding names (i.e. Natsuki becomes Natalie, Iketani is Cole, Itsuki is Iggy, Ryosuke is Ry, Keisuke is K.T., Nakazato is Zack, Kenta is Kyle, Mako and Sayuki become Maya and Simone, and Takumi goes by Tak). - The 'Eurobeat' Japanese-techno soundtrack is replaced with a mix of rap and garage-indie-punk music. - The opening and ending themes change, as well as the footage shown in the ending credits. - Various video effects, such as inverse colors, mirrors and wipe transitions are added to the CGI race scenes. - The original, authentic engine/exhaust noises are replaced with louder, more aggressive race noises. - Scenes involving Natsuki's shady, sexual dealings with the character referred to as 'Papa' were either cut down, or re-written (even the translation in the subtitled version was altered on the Tokyopop release)."
