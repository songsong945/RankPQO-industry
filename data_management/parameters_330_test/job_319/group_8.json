One involved him giving a large sum of money to a man representing a heart foundation who then keels over dead when he sees how much money the Texan had given him. The other involves the Texan asking for something to read while on the shuttle flight and Mary the stewardess gives him a huge pile of books. There's also an extra scene in line when Sonny Bono buys the $1 million dollar auto insurance policy.

In the US, the scene is completely edited out, though Jack Jones' credit is retained in the end credits. In the UK, the scene is present, but there is no music and Jones' voice cannot be heard, which naturally renders the joke incomprehensible. The soundtrack at this point is comprised solely of chirping crickets and the prison alarm.",

On the original home video, they looped his voice to announce \"Moon River\" and generic music is played instead. - Different music during end credits. - The scrolling end credits were retyped up so as to remove all of the song credits from the music that was edited out or replaced.",
