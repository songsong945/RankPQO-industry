Now known as Girls in the Street the following is missing: - A new credit sequence has had to be created, originally the film opened to its transvestite killer, beating up a woman and pulling her clothes off- most of this seen in 'window-box' form against the credits.  The new credits blank out this footage and are now set against red as apposed to the original black. - The massage parlour sequence is missing various shots of the man and woman's bottoms as well as full frontal male nudity.  Removed almost entirely is the sequence when the client goes insane and whips the girl with his belt, all that remains is a brief shot of the girls clothes being ripped off and the police dragging him off her. - The Peeping Tom scene is missing the couple smoking dope as well as some dialogue due to print damage. - A bloody shootout that follows the Peeping Tom scene is missing. - The bedroom scene with Sharon Kelly/Colleen Brennan is missing several shots that although not hard-core seem stronger than any simulation. - The 'bored housewives' scene is missing some shots off the girls on the couch and later phoning the police - A whole 4 minute scene featuring a bank robbery and the cops chasing the robber, which ends with the robbers car going over a cliff is deleted. - A scene where Streeker meets Haskell's wife is missing. - The transvestite sex killer's last victim is now 'spared' the killer's order to strip and his subsequent brutalization.",
