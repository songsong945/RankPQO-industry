An extended version of the ninja fight in the warehouse, with Blade using some fencing tactics to keep Asad at bay. A scene of Whistler shying away from the growing daylight outside.

A line by Whistler about \"the power of the pussy\" A Bloodpack \"meeting\" of sorts, with Chupa attempting to urge the others to kill Blade and go after the Reapers on their own. A scene in a bathroom after the House of Pain sequence of Lighthammer discovering how far his infection with the Reaper strain has gone. An extended scene of Damaskinos' dinner and blood bath, in which he tells of the fate of his human heart. An extended scene of the lawyer's torture of Blade A \"dirty\" version of the final scene, in which semen is streaked on the windows that was digitally removed in the final cut of the film because test audiences complained."
