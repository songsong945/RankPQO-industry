This credits sequence features all of the credits from the original 1962 episodes, as well as the first season of the new 1985 episodes, all lumped together (unlike what H-B did to _\"Flintstones, The\" (1960)_ (qv)--see the alternate versions listing for that series--these credits are not technically incorrect). The new 1987-88 syndication season features different credits (but the same basic credits *sequence*) as the 1985 version. In 1995, Turner started broadcasting and distributing prints that retained the original \"Jane! Stop this crazy thing!\" end titles."
