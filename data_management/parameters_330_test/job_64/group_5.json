The 1997 Maverick Directors video release was cut by 39 seconds to remove subliminal shots of anal sex during the murder scenes (one of which appears in the film though heavily darkened) and to edit a pan shot of a gay bar interior and shots of a knife being traced over a bound victims body. Although the uncut version was shown by Sky TV the film was resubmitted to the BBFC in 2003 for a FilmFour showing and many cuts were restored apart from a 1 sec edit to remove the subliminal shots. For the initial release on UK DVD in 2008 all the cuts were waived."

We learn now that he wasn't wearing a bathing suit - another scene shows Kathryn getting mad at her housekeeper, Mai-Lee. Mai-Lee accidently hurts Kathryn while doing her toe nails and Kathryn yells at her in Vietnamese - a third scene is from the end of the movie, when Kathryn and Annette meet each other in the bathroom of Manchester. Only a minor change of dialogue takes place here though - finally and most interestingly there is the alternate ending scene. Sebastian still gets hit by a car, but not because of saving Annette. He just stops fighting when he sees her standing across the street and gets hit when he crosses it. This scene is probably changed to the version as it appears in the movie because his death is more heroic that way."
