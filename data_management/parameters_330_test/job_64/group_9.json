The jacuzzi sex scene and the sex scene that follows on from it has been entirely cut out. The final sex scene in the barn has been edited down, removing wide shots that see the senator in-between Billy's legs having sex, shots from the waist up are the only sexual content seen; to maintain the continuity of the music shots of the CCTV camera and the man watching the sex on the monitor are re-used. The uncut version was broadcast on British television, Channel 5, in the late 90's."
