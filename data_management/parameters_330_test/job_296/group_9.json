However, in the USA, in the episodes with the Cree Summer theme songs, the Cree Summer version of the song was slowly replaced by the Macy Gray version (with \"Of Lice And Friends\" the last episode to use the Cree Summer version before the theme songs were completely replaced). Outside the USA, Melissa Disney (the voice of Ginger) sings the theme song of the first 2 episodes, the Cree Summer version used some episodes after and before the Macy Gray version, and the Macy Gray version in episodes after that, without them being replaced."
