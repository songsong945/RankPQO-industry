In addition, Chris was originally shown lighting a cigarette during the cast's introduction (this was replaced by superimposed colored footage of early shots of Chris from the intro). The second FMV movie altered was with the encounter with the first Zombie, in which showed Kenneth's half-eaten head is drop into the floor before the zombie himself faces the player. The third and final FMV that was change was Chris' \"bad\" ending, which was reshot so that Chris is no longer shown smoking (SCEA reportedly forbids any \"glorification\" of tobacco use in their games, despite the fact that SCEI has no problem with them).

This version had Leon in it (slightly different and maybe being an umbrella officer as well) and a young woman named Elza, some characters such as Kendo or Sherry were in it. The music was different, as well as the backgrounds and story. The RPD looked nothing like it does now and indeed looked more like a real police department, with darker backgrounds as well. The monsters and weapons were the same, except for a Zombie Gorilla which appeared, probably as a boss. Since news of this version spread out the fans have campaigned in order to have it released."
