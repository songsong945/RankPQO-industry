After Captain Michaels announces that they are heading to the Cape of Good Hope, he tells Dr. Helmsley that he has a phone call waiting for him. Dr. Helmsley discovers that his dad Harry is still alive. Harry tells his son that he, Tony (whose arm is in a sling) and some of the passengers and crew survived the mega-tsunami that struck the Genesis. Captain Michaels states that they should have a visual on the ocean-liner shortly. After Kate thanks Laura for taking care of Lily, Laura tells Jackson that she liked his book. Lily then announces that she sees an island. The Arks arrive at the shipwrecked Genesis and the survivors on the beach.",

After the premiere, director 'Stanley Kubrick' (qv) removed about 19 minutes' worth of scenes and made a few changes: - Some shots from the \"Dawn of Man\" sequence were removed and a new scene was inserted where an ape pauses with the bone it is about to use as a tool. The new scene was a low-angle shot of the monolith, done in order to portray and clarify the connection between the man-ape using the tool and the monolith. - Some shots of Frank Poole jogging in the centrifuge were removed. - An entire sequence of several shots in which Dave Bowman searches for the replacement antenna part in storage was removed. - A scene where HAL severs radio communication between the \"Discovery\" and Poole's pod before killing him was removed. This scene explains a line that stayed in the film in which Bowman addresses HAL on the subject. - Some shots of Poole's space walk before he is killed were removed.",
