During the extra footage Alan Partridge suggests an idea for a television programme. His idea is a programme called 'Bonnington' - starring Brian Blessed. Alan says: \"A screen mountaineering adventure with Brian Blessed in the title role.  We could film on location on Everest with close-ups on Skarfelt pike; no-one will know the difference, we'll just paint the rocks white. I also know for a fact that Brian Blessed can work at high altitudes without oxygen -- which should cut costs\".",

The re-broadcast of episode #1.03 \"The Diet\" on the 9th February 1953 featured a new opening \"Flashback\" sequence which ran for around two minutes. The flashback sequence involves Ricky, Ethel and Fred discussing the health of Lucy's new born baby. Ethel offers some homemade cookies for Lucy, but Ricky explains that Lucy is worried about her figure, and would like to go on a diet. The three then remember the last time Lucy went on a diet.
