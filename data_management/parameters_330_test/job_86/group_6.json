A scene is paused when Serena is walking home from school because she imagines her mother strangling her with a dog leash for getting a bad grade. In the English version, Luna says that they can take the disk to a computer store and look at it. In the Japanese version they go back to school and use the school's computer. When Amy realizes that she is late for computer school and abandons the Sailor V video game someone yells \"She had over 100,000 points!\" but the shot of the game screen shows a score of only 6850. Serena originally turns into a nurse, not a superintendent as in the DIC version, which is why she looks so much like a nurse.",

In the next episode he is supposed to be surprised because Serena knows his name and he doesn't know hers but in English, it seems like he suddenly doesn't recognize her at all. Some things have to be changed. Serena and Molly ask Anne to say something in French. Originally, they ask her to say something in English.",
