This version was shortened by approx. 20 minutes, all actors voices redubbed to make them more American-sounding (most notably that of Abronsius), the music was slightly altered and a cartoon prologue featuring Abronsius & Alfred was added. This was done by producer 'Martin Ransohoff' (qv) without 'Roman Polanski' (qv)'s approval. Other edits included the shortening of the trip to Krolock's castle, the shots of Shagal watching the maid cleaning the floor as he stomps the sauerkraut, and Alfred searching for the mysterious voice in the castle corridors. Ransohoff also tried to have the American version distributed under the title \"The Fearless Vampire Killers: or, Pardon Me But Your Teeth are in my Neck\". Upon seeing this American version, Polanski tried to have his name removed from the credits. The prints that are currently being used have been restored to their original British length of 107 minutes and carry the title of simply \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\".",

However, Fine Line Features president 'Mark Ordesky' (qv) informed director 'Lars von Trier' (qv) that such an opening was unfeasible in U.S. theaters, since most American theaters don't have curtains and have electronic projection booths overseen by inexperienced staffers. Thus, von Trier filmed a visual accompaniment to go along with the overture in the U.S. release: a collage of paintings by Per Kirkeby, the artist/husband of producer 'Vibeke Windel\u00f8v' (qv).",
