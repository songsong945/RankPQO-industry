        "The TV print substitutes tamer versions of some of 10's racier moments. In particular, scenes featuring porn star Annette Haven as Dudley Moore's exhibitionist neighbor have been removed, replaced with scenes involving another actress. On scene features Moore's character using a telescope to watch a naked A. Haven making love (in the TV version, we see the substitute actress kissing a man while wearing a robe). A later scene, originally shown as a nude orgy, is replaced by a similar scene, but with everyone wearing bathing suits. In addition, the comedic lovemaking scene between Derek and Moore is played in the dark in the TV version.",
