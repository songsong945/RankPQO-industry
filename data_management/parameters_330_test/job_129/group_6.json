The scene in which Pedro and Sancho are telling the story about the city of gold is shortened (they don't talk about how the patrons of the bar should invest in their adventure.)

The ending of Episode 1 is omitted in that Esteban discovers Zia only. The scene in which Mendoza smiles at the discovery that Esteban makes of Zia, and the both looking to see the clouds turn into the winged serpent forshadowing things to come is not there. - Episode 2: The daydreaming scene in which the golden butterflies turns into the city of gold is omitted, as well as the daydreaming scene in which Esteban is seasick and floating above the mayan ruins. - Episode 3: The daydreaming scene of the seamonster eating the ship is omitted. - Episode 4: Has the longest runtime of all the episodes of the series contains many additions, cuts, and an alternate ending. Additions include Extended footage of Mendoza rescuing the children with Esteban grabbing onto him through the bars so he doesn't get sucked out, followed by Dialogue of Gomez on the deck of the ship saying something about Gaspard.

To try and get around censorship laws, the show was marketed as \"Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles\" and the names of cerain weapons and places were changed. Towards the end of the show's run, the format changed almost entirely as part of a trend to make shows more \"extreme\" to appeal to a new generation of viewers: - Shredder and Krang were removed from the show for over a sesaon. New villains came in the form of giant space slugs involved in organized crime; - Almost all character building scenes were removed to make it an entirely action oriented show; - April and Splinter's roles were diminished considerably; - The turtles voices were altered to sound more deep and aggressive; - The cartoon feel of the show was removed--The sky was changed from blue with white clouds to red with gray clouds and buildings were drawn as if destroyed; - Irma, Verne, April's boss, Baxter Stockman, Ratking, and numerous other characters were totally removed from the show; - In addition, the opening sequence was hiked up, changing the music to a techno beat with flashing lights and scenes from the Tutles movies intercut with new scenes from the show.",

Esteban's run in the city to the tavern is shorter, but an additional overhead shot is shown. The scene in which Pedro and Sancho are telling the story about the city of gold is shortened (they don't talk about how the patrons of the bar should invest in their adventure.) There is an additional scene of Esteban looking shocked when the official says \"find him and you'll receive a whole piece of gold.\" There is a scene difference in when Mendoza is waiting for Esteban at the dock, he waits longer, but Esteban's run to meet him is shorter. The ending of Episode 1 is omitted in that Esteban discovers Zia only. The scene in which Mendoza smiles at the discovery that Esteban makes of Zia, and the both looking to see the clouds turn into the winged serpent forshadowing things to come is not there. - Episode 2: The daydreaming scene in which the golden butterflies turns into the city of gold is omitted, as well as the daydreaming scene in which Esteban is seasick and floating above the mayan ruins. - Episode 3: The daydreaming scene of the seamonster eating the ship is omitted. - Episode 4: Has the longest runtime of all the episodes of the series contains many additions, cuts, and an alternate ending. Additions include Extended footage of Mendoza rescuing the children with Esteban grabbing onto him through the bars so he doesn't get sucked out, followed by Dialogue of Gomez on the deck of the ship saying something about Gaspard. Gomez then slides down the deck of the ship and gets into the boat. There is a scene added in which Pedro and Sancho wake up in each others arms on the deck of the Esperanza when Esteban calls to Mendoza about the St. Elmos fire. There is also an extended scene after the shark attack where Pedro and Sancho say something off camera, and goes into an on camera dialogue with Esteban and Zia's dialogue about Esteban's father. - Omitted scene: There is a small scene of the raft sitting still in the sunlight. - Alternate Ending: Once the Island is discovered our heroes merely paddle their way toward the island, seeing shots of the lizards, and shots of the island.

        "The Japanese version has been released on DVD, and some differences to be found in this release compared to the English/French version are: - Opening credits are much longer with scenes of the children running through the ruins, and a live shot of the Pelican (from Documentary number 5) - Entirely different music and sometimes different sound effects - Episode 1: Starts off with a live action ship in a storm, fading into a map of the area of spain, and then on to the God Shot. Esteban's run in the city to the tavern is shorter, but an additional overhead shot is shown. The scene in which Pedro and Sancho are telling the story about the city of gold is shortened (they don't talk about how the patrons of the bar should invest in their adventure.) There is an additional scene of Esteban looking shocked when the official says \"find him and you'll receive a whole piece of gold.\" There is a scene difference in when Mendoza is waiting for Esteban at the dock, he waits longer, but Esteban's run to meet him is shorter. The ending of Episode 1 is omitted in that Esteban discovers Zia only. The scene in which Mendoza smiles at the discovery that Esteban makes of Zia, and the both looking to see the clouds turn into the winged serpent forshadowing things to come is not there. - Episode 2: The daydreaming scene in which the golden butterflies turns into the city of gold is omitted, as well as the daydreaming scene in which Esteban is seasick and floating above the mayan ruins. - Episode 3: The daydreaming scene of the seamonster eating the ship is omitted. - Episode 4: Has the longest runtime of all the episodes of the series contains many additions, cuts, and an alternate ending. Additions include Extended footage of Mendoza rescuing the children with Esteban grabbing onto him through the bars so he doesn't get sucked out, followed by Dialogue of Gomez on the deck of the ship saying something about Gaspard. Gomez then slides down the deck of the ship and gets into the boat. There is a scene added in which Pedro and Sancho wake up in each others arms on the deck of the Esperanza when Esteban calls to Mendoza about the St. Elmos fire. There is also an extended scene after the shark attack where Pedro and Sancho say something off camera, and goes into an on camera dialogue with Esteban and Zia's dialogue about Esteban's father. - Omitted scene: There is a small scene of the raft sitting still in the sunlight. - Alternate Ending: Once the Island is discovered our heroes merely paddle their way toward the island, seeing shots of the lizards, and shots of the island. The Episode ends right here, and the entire footage in the English/French versions of Mendoza swimming from the sharks is gone. - Some of the scenes from Episode 4 alternate ending and the rescue can be seen in the English/French version Previous and To Follow segments - Episode 5: This starts where the English/French Episode 4 ends at the raft on the island. There is a scene omission of Zia lifting her dress to sit down. This Episode ends right where Tao points the crossbow at Esteban. - Episode 6: Starts in the tree house right where Episode 5 left off, and has a small scene of Mendoza Pedro and Sancho arriving on the raft. From this point forward all Episodes are in Synch with the English/French versions, with very few differences. - Episode 9: Starts with an additional second of footage zoomed in on the Solaris's sail - Episode 27: Has a second of footage containing a lightning bolt omitted at the start of the Episode - Episode 29: In the Japanese version when Esteban Tao and Zia are struck by the Olmec ray, Esteban spins around much slower and the background isn't changed as much. - Closing Credits: There is an additional bit of animation used of the sun and then transitioning to Esteban's face - None of the previous, to follows, or live action documentaries are on the Japanese DVD's",
