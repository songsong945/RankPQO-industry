        "In Latin America, the Sony Channel (Sony Entertainment Television) aired all the episodes that were filmed. In the U.S., Peter Dragon dies in the final episode, but (at least in Latin America) he continued production after that episode: he got back with Wendy, and learned that Adam Rafkin (the script writer) had previously sold the movie he was filming under a different title. Then Peter had to buy the script back, giving Wendy as a trade. In the end, Wendy left Peter and Hollywood after making him promise he would return all the money she had invested. In the final scene, Uncle Lonnie asks Peter if he wants to go home, and Peter asks Lonnie to take him to the studio, because \"that's my home\".",
