But due to various circumstances at the time (political climate, the 2002 shooting at a school in Erfurt), the approval was denied. To release the film at all, German distributor Kinowelt had to cut the film. This cut version still only had the SPIO/JK approval and no FSK rating. Among the cut scenes were the following: - Kitano killing Fujiyoshi with his knife - Kitano killing Nobu by activating the collar - All notes telling the viewer who was killed and how many survivors were left were deleted - Mitsuko killing Megumi with a sickle - Much of Kitanos comments, such as \"It's tough when friends die on you, but hang in there!\" - Kiriyama killing the two girls with the MP was shortened - View of Kitano's picture was shortened - Nanahara saying \"She took the knife that Nobu use to stab Kitano from the desk.\" In 2004 the film was re-released by Marketing Film, this time it was uncut.",
