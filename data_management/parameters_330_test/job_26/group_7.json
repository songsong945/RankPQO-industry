In the last room he goes into, he sees a small kitty at the party and says \"awww!\" before leaving a second later. -Festus is shown giving Tori a mushroom pizza and running away upon hearing Cat's new voice before Trina runs towards Tori to talk about the party. After their conversation about the party, Trina traded Tori's pizza for her pizza after finding out that hers has mushrooms in it. Then Sinjin takes Trina's pizza that was given to Tori so now she is seen going back to the Grub Truck. -Tori and Steven are seen watching an extended iCarly webcast (previously only seen on iCarly.com), and Steven claims to have never heard of iCarly or the web-show hosts. -Mr. Howard is talking about Sacajawea before he calls Carly and Sam up.
