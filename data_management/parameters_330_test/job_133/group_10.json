Later, Raye talks about how she is helping Maya overcome her nerves. In Japanese, Rei talks about how hard Maya works and begins to feel some despair about how hard one needs to work to be successful. In the end, she and Serena agree to just do their best.

When Molly and Melvin pull out their contest tickets to show Serena, Molly says \"You blew it, Melvin\"; a comment which doesn't seem connected to anything. Another odd translation is when the girls gang up on Amy for saying that she wants to \"witness\" the contest.  In Japanese, she says that she might learn something from the contest.  The other girls want to know what Amy thinks she needs to learn from a lover's contest - and who she needs to learn it for! Later, when Amara immediately finds Michelle's hand in the first contest event, Ami says (in Japanese) \"I wonder if it's that kind of relationship.\" That's why the girls all look at Ami and Ami looks embarrassed.  In English, Amy makes some sort of neutral comment. In English, one of the girls comments that Michelle and Amara are cousins. The English episode gets really mixed up in that the translators can't seem to decide if it's a \"Friendship Contest\" or a \"Love Contest\".  At the beginning they go to great effort to make it a \"Friendship\" contest, but then the part where Amara is embarrassed to call out Michelle's name doesn't make sense. At the end, when Melvin makes his love confession to Molly, the translators seem to give up on \"Friendship\" and it becomes a \"Love\" contest again. When the couples go to confess their love, one man charges towards the woman yelling something about love being a battle.  She conks him over the head with a giant mallet.  In English you see the \"before\" and \"after\" but not the actual bonk on the head.",

        "In \"Hello, Sailor Mini Moon\", Serena and the other girls wonder why Raye gave them the brush-off, then they spot her in a dessert parlor with another girl. The girls start to wonder if Raye is dumping them and getting a new best friend. In Japanese, Minako suggests that Rei may be on a date with the girl! Usagi can't believe it but Minako points that it could be just like Haruka and Michiru. Then Mako (Lita) wonders if the girl might really be a man dressed as a woman! Raye agrees to help Maya with her problem, but in Japanese it's actually the reverse - Maya agrees to help Raye by performing at the festival. Later, Raye talks about how she is helping Maya overcome her nerves. In Japanese, Rei talks about how hard Maya works and begins to feel some despair about how hard one needs to work to be successful. In the end, she and Serena agree to just do their best. This episode introduces a new voice for Rini (now played by Stephanie Beard).  Sailor Mini Moon is called Sailor Chibi Moon in Japanese (chibi=small, mini).",
