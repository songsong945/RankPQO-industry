One can only assume this is Bean's idea of security for his apartment. - Bean and David riding around Los Angeles more - Bean and David posing for a picture at the fairgrounds - Bean taking one last picture of David before he boards the plane back home. He motions for David to move back. David backs up so much he ends ups falling over a large pile of luggage - Bean wearing sunglasses and holding a sign that reads 'Jack Nicholson'. He is obviously posing for a picture as he grins like Nicholson and points to the sign and then himself. - Bean doing a Broadway-like dance with a fedora hat on the steps outside his workplace - More shots of Bean giving the finger to everyone - Bean drinking Champagne while flying to America and then making faces after sampling some - Bean with the turkey stuck on his head actually walking outside the Langley house and nearly getting hit by a car and then falling in a bush"

Bean then holds the hotdog to his mouth open wide as David takes a picture of him. When he finally is about to eat the hotdog, he pauses, looks at what's been put on it, smells it, and recoils with a look of nausea."

        "The deleted scenes that are shown in thr 15 minute segment before the film include the following: - Bean driving to work in his trademark black and yellow Austin Mini and getting caught in a traffic jam outside of Harrods department store. Seeing two doorman holding open the doors for customers, Bean seizes the opportunity and simply drives through the doors, around the inside of the store and then out the other side to get through the jam. - Bean pulling up to a 'No Parking' sign at his place of work, getting out a pair of false legs, pushing them underneath the car, and dropping some wrenches next to the legs to simulate his making repairs. - Bean hearing the news that he'll be going to America. He thinks that everyone will be carrying a gun so he makes believe he's holding a gun with his hands, and mimics Eastwood-like moves and even says to a man, \"Are you feeling lucky punk?\" - Bean reprising the 'head in the lap' gag in which he is wearing a blindfold to help him sleep while on the plane to America. He starts to fall down in his seat and then manages to have his head fall into the crotch of the passenger sitting next to him. The passenger yells for a stewardess to switch him to a different seat and Bean tries to make sense of the situation by screaming \"I'M BLIND!\" since he is still wearing the blindfold. - The Langley family falls asleep waiting for Bean at the airport. What they don't know is that Bean actually HAS arrived at their house by way of a Taxi. He gets inside and plays around with a remote control for what he thinks is the TV but is actually the garage door opener. Bean then picks up a SONY Walkman for the first time and then starts to listen to music and do an impromptu dance in his pajamas all over the house. - The Langley's arriving home and Bean using their bathroom. Bean and David continue a set of 'near misses' as one goes outside the room as another comes in. Bean, searching for his toothpaste, comes across what he thinks is David's toothpaste but is actually a tube of medicinal toe cream. Bean puts it on his toothbrush, brushes and after a bit smiles and says \"Mmmm! Nice!\" - A lot more of Bean's destroying of Whistler's mother (A lot of the pictures for this scene can be found in the books for the film) is shown. Bean going into the Grierson Gallery men's room and attempting to wash off the ink by using a toilet brush. Hearing others who want to use the facilities, Bean places the painting outside a window and onto the building's ledge. He then walks out on the ledge and tries to grab it while trying not to disrupt the security meeting with David, Elmer, George, Bernice, and Walter. - Bean tries to calm David's panic over the destroyed painting by coming up with the idea of placing a tiny piece of paper saying \"DO NOT COME IN\" on the doors. David's reaction to this is \"EXCELLENT! It's perfect! Problem is solved! Apart from one tiny drawback, that someone will eventually walk through that door, they'll see the painting and say, \"Oh look, someone has completely destroyed 'Whistler's Mother'. Let's Kill Them!!!\" leaving Bean at a loss for words. - A 'breakfast' scene at the Langley's shows Bean making scrambled eggs and toast for David and Andrew while David tries to think of what to say at the unveiling. \"I get to go in and tell everyone that 'Whistler's Mother' now looks like Pinocchio's Father!\" - An extended scene of Burt Reynolds' character General Newton meeting the staff of the Grierson Gallery including Bean."

All scenes of him giving this gesture are cut from the film, an edit all the more perplexing as one of these scenes is shown in an advert for the movie."
