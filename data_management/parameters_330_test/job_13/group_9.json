        "All pre-2005 UK versions were cut by 1 minute 38 secs, and these were voluntary cuts by the distributor to ensure a PG rather than a 12 rating. The cuts were as follows........ A shot of a cutting torch being picked up just after the main logo is missing. Two Face's reply after the guard says \"You said you'd let me live\" is missing. After the 'punctual funeral' line, Two Face shouting \"Kill the Bat!\" has been removed from the soundtrack and replaced with music and guards grunting. When the elevator dings just before Batman exits, Two Face's shout of \"Blast him!\" was not present in the UK version. The fight outside the elevator has lost a lot of sound effects, as well as a sequence where Batman drops his leg sharply onto a thug's chest, complete with a loud thud. Batman delivering a backward head butt and breaking a thug's nose in extreme close-up has been removed. Close-ups of kicks to midriffs and faces are also missing. Two Face's lines in the helicopter about the acid have been removed. In the sequence where the helicopter pilot is killed, Two Face emptying an entire clip into the helicopter pilot has been trimmed, along with shots showing the bullets riddling the pilot's body from the front. The cut UK version had only three shots fired, and the pilot is shown slumping from behind. The death of Stickley does not show him stopping on the window ledge, and hanging in terror, before Nygma runs over and says \"Fred, babe! You are fired! Or should I say...terminated?\". With this, he pulls the hat off him and he falls down, but this was all cut from the UK print. Two Face's line in the circus big top was cut from the UK version, \"Our new act for your personal amazement: we call it - Massacre Under The Big Top!\". A shot of Nygma laughing at the above line is also missing. When the Mayor asks what Two Face wants at the circus, his reply is shortened from \"Batman - bruised, broken, bleeding. In a word, dead!\" to simply \"Batman\". The UK version is missing the sequence where Bruce Wayne kills one guard on the right side of the big drum by coming up behind him, breaking his neck, and smacking him in the face as he falls. When Two Face flips his coin before killing the Graysons, after his evil laugh he goes on to say \"Their kind of day\", which was missing in the UK version. As the bomb is raised through the roof of the circus, a quick sequence of Bruce flipping a guard over and kicking him hard in the gut is missing. When Two Face accidentally kills two of his men in the car, their screams have been cut short in the UK version, and a shot of the driver's terrified face has been removed. The fight at Nygma's party loses some impact sounds. Shortly after this, Batman makes a guard do the splits and another crack accompanies this, but the sound has virtually been eliminated from the soundtrack. A small crack has been greatly reduced in volume as Batman twists a thug's arm backwards Robin throwing Two Face a vicious head butts after the line, \"This is for me!\" has been replaced in the UK version, by removing the punch Robin throws after he says \"This is for my brother\" and reinserting in place of the head butt."

        "Following attacks from politicians on violent films aimed at children, Warner Brothers. pushed the release date back and recut the film to a tamer version, toning down some of the violence in the original cut sent out in screener tapes. On April 23, 2001, the unedited version of the film was released in the US exclusively on DVD. Up until that point the uncut version had only been released as screeners that were sent out before the changes were made. The following are scenes that were changed in the edited-for-content version: - Lots of white flashes have been added to the action sequences where there were previously none. Additionally, combinations of punches have been mostly trimmed down to one punch. For example, Woof slashes the guard once now instead of twice. Batman no longer punches Ghoul in the gut, he just uppercuts him into the dish. Later on in the club, Terry's vicious attack on Ghoul is cut to a flash and Terry running away while Ghoul falls. There is a 360-degree fight sequence in the opening battle that has also been removed, where Batman fends off the Jokerz one by one. - Seat belts added to Terry and Bruce as the drive home after their first meeting with the new Joker. - Bonk is not shot, but given a lethal dose of laughing gas, and he dies off screen. Because of this the whole \"Take the trash outside, Dee Dee\" and \"Are you with me?\" sequence is cut. - When Bruce throws the batarang it appears as though he's pleased he can still throw & catch a batarang instead of it showing him using it to decapitate a Two Face dummy. - When Terry enters the Batcave to find it demolished by the Joker, the letter's 'HA! HA!' written across the floor are changed from red to purple. Probably to assure us it is not written on Bruce's blood. - All other blood is removed. (Only one example was passed over. In the flashback sequence when Batman smashes through the projection he smacks the Joker. Blots of blood fly from the Jokers mouth, but he is not bleeding in the next shot.) - In the unedited version, when Batman (in the present) frees himself from the Jokers' ribbon wrap, he throws the knife that he used to free himself with at the Joker. The Joker ducks at the last second and the blade goes through the stage curtain. This would explain the hole behind the Joker. - The Joker is not shot, but slips in some water and is electrocuted off screen. Plus, they don't mention they buried him deep under Arkham or any of that. The dialogue is completely changed in that sequence. - Barbara says that Leslie Thompkins helped Tim Drake \"regain himself\" instead of \"regain his sanity.\" (or something along those lines) - During a montage where Batman and Batgirl comb \"the underworld\" looking for clues about Robin's disappearance, Batgirl talks to a nicely-dressed man and woman instead of two sleazily-dressed women (who are pretty obviously hookers) on a street corner. - Also, Joker no longer slices Batman across the chest of in the leg, and any blood is digitally removed. Joker just punches Batman. - More than half of the \"Our Family Memories\" is cut out, only showing Robin tied up and struggling, and cutting the scene where Joker opens the barbeque lids, picks up the voltage tongs, and shocks the Boy. - A lot of dialogue is changed as well. And reference to the word \"kill\" is changed. - The opening fight seqeunce is trimmed, cutting out a second Dee-Dee kick and completely redoing that entire Batman/Dee Dee sequence. - The club fight is changed. The pink clown no longer punches Terry and says \"I don't know why the boss wants a dreg like you outta the way, but as long as it's fun...\". He just goes for his gun and says \"Slag him!\". - Bruce says \"Robin defeated him.\" instead of \"Robin did kill him\". Joker says \"Bat-Kook\" instead of \"Bat-Fart\". Jordan Price says \"Ice\" instead of \"kill\". Tim Drake says \"I can still hear his scream\" instead of \"I can still hear the shot\". Joker says \"...with such yutzes\" instead of \"...with such putzes\". - In the scene where the satellite laser chases the Batmoblie it blasts an unmarked, dark, seemingly empty building. Originally it was a lit movie theater. (In the edited version the word 'cineplex' can be seen exploding out of the wreckage in the last few frames of the shot.) - The clothing on 'Nanna Harley' is changed from blue and purple to Harley Quinn's trademark red and black."

        "All pre-2005 UK versions were cut by 1 minute 38 secs, and these were voluntary cuts by the distributor to ensure a PG rather than a 12 rating. The cuts were as follows........ A shot of a cutting torch being picked up just after the main logo is missing. Two Face's reply after the guard says \"You said you'd let me live\" is missing. After the 'punctual funeral' line, Two Face shouting \"Kill the Bat!\" has been removed from the soundtrack and replaced with music and guards grunting. When the elevator dings just before Batman exits, Two Face's shout of \"Blast him!\" was not present in the UK version. The fight outside the elevator has lost a lot of sound effects, as well as a sequence where Batman drops his leg sharply onto a thug's chest, complete with a loud thud. Batman delivering a backward head butt and breaking a thug's nose in extreme close-up has been removed. Close-ups of kicks to midriffs and faces are also missing. Two Face's lines in the helicopter about the acid have been removed. In the sequence where the helicopter pilot is killed, Two Face emptying an entire clip into the helicopter pilot has been trimmed, along with shots showing the bullets riddling the pilot's body from the front. The cut UK version had only three shots fired, and the pilot is shown slumping from behind. The death of Stickley does not show him stopping on the window ledge, and hanging in terror, before Nygma runs over and says \"Fred, babe! You are fired! Or should I say...terminated?\". With this, he pulls the hat off him and he falls down, but this was all cut from the UK print. Two Face's line in the circus big top was cut from the UK version, \"Our new act for your personal amazement: we call it - Massacre Under The Big Top!\". A shot of Nygma laughing at the above line is also missing. When the Mayor asks what Two Face wants at the circus, his reply is shortened from \"Batman - bruised, broken, bleeding. In a word, dead!\" to simply \"Batman\". The UK version is missing the sequence where Bruce Wayne kills one guard on the right side of the big drum by coming up behind him, breaking his neck, and smacking him in the face as he falls. When Two Face flips his coin before killing the Graysons, after his evil laugh he goes on to say \"Their kind of day\", which was missing in the UK version. As the bomb is raised through the roof of the circus, a quick sequence of Bruce flipping a guard over and kicking him hard in the gut is missing. When Two Face accidentally kills two of his men in the car, their screams have been cut short in the UK version, and a shot of the driver's terrified face has been removed. The fight at Nygma's party loses some impact sounds. Shortly after this, Batman makes a guard do the splits and another crack accompanies this, but the sound has virtually been eliminated from the soundtrack. A small crack has been greatly reduced in volume as Batman twists a thug's arm backwards Robin throwing Two Face a vicious head butts after the line, \"This is for me!\" has been replaced in the UK version, by removing the punch Robin throws after he says \"This is for my brother\" and reinserting in place of the head butt."

        "Following attacks from politicians on violent films aimed at children, Warner Brothers. pushed the release date back and recut the film to a tamer version, toning down some of the violence in the original cut sent out in screener tapes. On April 23, 2001, the unedited version of the film was released in the US exclusively on DVD. Up until that point the uncut version had only been released as screeners that were sent out before the changes were made. The following are scenes that were changed in the edited-for-content version: - Lots of white flashes have been added to the action sequences where there were previously none. Additionally, combinations of punches have been mostly trimmed down to one punch. For example, Woof slashes the guard once now instead of twice. Batman no longer punches Ghoul in the gut, he just uppercuts him into the dish. Later on in the club, Terry's vicious attack on Ghoul is cut to a flash and Terry running away while Ghoul falls. There is a 360-degree fight sequence in the opening battle that has also been removed, where Batman fends off the Jokerz one by one. - Seat belts added to Terry and Bruce as the drive home after their first meeting with the new Joker. - Bonk is not shot, but given a lethal dose of laughing gas, and he dies off screen. Because of this the whole \"Take the trash outside, Dee Dee\" and \"Are you with me?\" sequence is cut. - When Bruce throws the batarang it appears as though he's pleased he can still throw & catch a batarang instead of it showing him using it to decapitate a Two Face dummy. - When Terry enters the Batcave to find it demolished by the Joker, the letter's 'HA! HA!' written across the floor are changed from red to purple. Probably to assure us it is not written on Bruce's blood. - All other blood is removed. (Only one example was passed over. In the flashback sequence when Batman smashes through the projection he smacks the Joker. Blots of blood fly from the Jokers mouth, but he is not bleeding in the next shot.) - In the unedited version, when Batman (in the present) frees himself from the Jokers' ribbon wrap, he throws the knife that he used to free himself with at the Joker. The Joker ducks at the last second and the blade goes through the stage curtain. This would explain the hole behind the Joker. - The Joker is not shot, but slips in some water and is electrocuted off screen. Plus, they don't mention they buried him deep under Arkham or any of that. The dialogue is completely changed in that sequence. - Barbara says that Leslie Thompkins helped Tim Drake \"regain himself\" instead of \"regain his sanity.\" (or something along those lines) - During a montage where Batman and Batgirl comb \"the underworld\" looking for clues about Robin's disappearance, Batgirl talks to a nicely-dressed man and woman instead of two sleazily-dressed women (who are pretty obviously hookers) on a street corner. - Also, Joker no longer slices Batman across the chest of in the leg, and any blood is digitally removed. Joker just punches Batman. - More than half of the \"Our Family Memories\" is cut out, only showing Robin tied up and struggling, and cutting the scene where Joker opens the barbeque lids, picks up the voltage tongs, and shocks the Boy. - A lot of dialogue is changed as well. And reference to the word \"kill\" is changed. - The opening fight seqeunce is trimmed, cutting out a second Dee-Dee kick and completely redoing that entire Batman/Dee Dee sequence. - The club fight is changed. The pink clown no longer punches Terry and says \"I don't know why the boss wants a dreg like you outta the way, but as long as it's fun...\". He just goes for his gun and says \"Slag him!\". - Bruce says \"Robin defeated him.\" instead of \"Robin did kill him\". Joker says \"Bat-Kook\" instead of \"Bat-Fart\". Jordan Price says \"Ice\" instead of \"kill\". Tim Drake says \"I can still hear his scream\" instead of \"I can still hear the shot\". Joker says \"...with such yutzes\" instead of \"...with such putzes\". - In the scene where the satellite laser chases the Batmoblie it blasts an unmarked, dark, seemingly empty building. Originally it was a lit movie theater. (In the edited version the word 'cineplex' can be seen exploding out of the wreckage in the last few frames of the shot.) - The clothing on 'Nanna Harley' is changed from blue and purple to Harley Quinn's trademark red and black."

This scene was shot but cut. The original opening can be partially seen in the U2 music video \"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\". In it the infamous \"THE BAT MUST DIE\" line is shown for a second written in a wall with bloody white letters."

Besides being dubbed into Spanish, the film's ending is heavily edited as follows: When The Joker puts on glasses and says: \"You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses on, would you?\" Batman punches him and knocks him over the edge. In the original version the climax continues beyond this point. But in this changed version, The Joker simply plummets to his death after the punch. This was achieved by cutting from the punch to the birds-eye-view shot of The Joker falling. The next shot is simply The Joker lying dead and the crowd of people looming over him. The entire struggle on the ledge and attempted helicopter escape are completely omitted."
