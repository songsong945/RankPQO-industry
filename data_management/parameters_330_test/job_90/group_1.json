Now, although this is basically the same as the Anchor Bay version, it is compiled from original source prints and not from a VHS source, as Anchor Bay's was. Not only that, it offers 5.1 sound and the scene where Bad Ash tears off Shelia's dress top has been added back.  A must-have for any collector of this film.",
