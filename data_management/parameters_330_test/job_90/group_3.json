Altogether, there are 13 separate stories consisting of 52 episodes. In Germany however, for 12 of the 13 stories the four original episodes were cut to three episodes for one story, each with a runtime of about 25 minutes (PAL). In the German version only one story consists of all 4 episodes with the full runtime. This means, that in Germany all 13 stories were shown, but only 40 episodes were dubbed and broadcast. In the German version 12 stories, which originally have a runtime of approximately 100 minutes (PAL), were shortened by about 25 minutes to 75 minutes (PAL), and many sequences and even some important story lines are missing. There was also a \"Captain Future\" special named \"Star Trail To Glory\" (in French: \"La course \u00e0 travers le syst\u00e8me solaire\") consisting of two episodes (as a result, there are 54 episodes altogether), which is available in France on video and DVD as a movie. These two episodes have never been shown (or dubbed) in Germany.",

There is also a strange cut in the episode, the original version says King Koopa: Blame it on the rain? Blame it on King Koopa. to King Koopa: [lip sync to nothing], Blame it on King Koopa. The other cut is when in the original version Milli Vanilli play Girl, You Know It's True (at the end), Mario says Lights out, Princess. Er, uh, Princess? Maybe if we keep our band, we'll be that popular! (Mario, Luigi, and Toad shake their heads which Princess just stares at Milli Vanilli and claps her hands). Instead, Megamove plays and the curtain falls.",
