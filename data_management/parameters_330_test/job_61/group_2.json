Originally during the beginning of the closing credits, dialogue went like this: Bobby: \"You kicked her ass, Mom\". Peggy: \"Yes\". Bobby: \"But she's a better dancer than you.\" Peggy: \"You do not know that.\" That was cut and just featured Bill saying, \"And if she does come back, well, then I'll call the police.\""

Now the title just appears over the heads of Hank, Bill, Dale and Boomhauer whereas in the original version, the title appeared on a seperate screen with Hank's head in the middle; In the original airing of the episode \"Square Peg\", during the credits, Hank drove up on his riding mower and apologized if the content of the episode was offending to anyone. This was probably cut because Hanks says \"Coming up next is a show called X-Files\" which he thought was a pornography show but it's about a man and woman who don't have sex."
