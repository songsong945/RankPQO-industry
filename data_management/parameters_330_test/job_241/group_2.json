Instead the Earth based scene took place in a bowling alley. - The Command Center's interior had different control panels and lighting. - The plating on Alpha 5's upper torso was notably larger and didn't have the familiar \"lightning bolt\" logo. - 'Flyguy', renamed 'King Sphinx' for his eventual appearance in the TV series, appeared in the episode to battle the rangers with 'Goldar'. -The Dinozords were known as Dinodroids'. - There was a Bulk character, but no Skull character. Instead there were three other bullies/punks alongside Bulk.",
