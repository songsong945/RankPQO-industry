The opening MGM credits are not the originals but a recreation using the ones from \"Big Business\" changing the title and certain names. Most of the film itself was lifted from elements used in a Robert Youngson compilation and for this reason the quality of the images notably switches from excellent to terrible, since the rest of the film was probably lifted from worn 16mm prints.",

Both of these scenes contain nudity, and have been substituted with less-offensive scenes in the US-DVD.
