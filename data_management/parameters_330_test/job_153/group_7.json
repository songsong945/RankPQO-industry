The American producers found this idea too disturbing for children, so this version was reworked so that Vacak (now Tiny) was separated from his loving family by being distracted by a frog and falling off the cliff. Most of the animation in this section was produced especially for this sequence. - The Dr. Owl character is introduced at the beginning as the narrator whereas he was introduced much later in the original. - The scene where Vacak (Tiny) hears his family looking for him was added, followed by a gentle musical number when the family do not hear him. More animation was added for this sequence."
