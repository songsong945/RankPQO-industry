In Germany however, for 12 of the 13 stories the four original episodes were cut to three episodes for one story, each with a runtime of about 25 minutes (PAL).

There was also a \"Captain Future\" special named \"Star Trail To Glory\" (in French: \"La course \u00e0 travers le syst\u00e8me solaire\") consisting of two episodes (as a result, there are 54 episodes altogether), which is available in France on video and DVD as a movie.

Altogether, there are 13 separate stories consisting of 52 episodes. In Germany however, for 12 of the 13 stories the four original episodes were cut to three episodes for one story, each with a runtime of about 25 minutes (PAL). In the German version only one story consists of all 4 episodes with the full runtime. This means, that in Germany all 13 stories were shown, but only 40 episodes were dubbed and broadcast. In the German version 12 stories, which originally have a runtime of approximately 100 minutes (PAL), were shortened by about 25 minutes to 75 minutes (PAL), and many sequences and even some important story lines are missing. There was also a \"Captain Future\" special named \"Star Trail To Glory\" (in French: \"La course \u00e0 travers le syst\u00e8me solaire\") consisting of two episodes (as a result, there are 54 episodes altogether), which is available in France on video and DVD as a movie. These two episodes have never been shown (or dubbed) in Germany."
