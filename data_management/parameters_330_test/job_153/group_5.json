These edits were restored in video releases though the 2006 DD Entertainment DVD features the cut cinema print. In the U.S however the film was cut differently. The 'ravishing' of Rosa was left intact but 3 cuts were made to the stabbings of Bolton and the night watchman, and the surgical cutting of a patient's leg. The U.S Criterion DVD features the U.S cinema print though the cut scenes are presented as extra features on the disc."
