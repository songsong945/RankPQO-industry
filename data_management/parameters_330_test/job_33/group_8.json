More noticeably, all of Milli Vanilli's songs (Blame it on the Rain and Girl, You Know It's True) were altered to an Captain N: The Game Master instrumental called Megamove. There is also a strange cut in the episode, the original version says King Koopa: Blame it on the rain? Blame it on King Koopa. to King Koopa: [lip sync to nothing], Blame it on King Koopa. The other cut is when in the original version Milli Vanilli play Girl, You Know It's True (at the end), Mario says Lights out, Princess. Er, uh, Princess? Maybe if we keep our band, we'll be that popular! (Mario, Luigi, and Toad shake their heads which Princess just stares at Milli Vanilli and claps her hands). Instead, Megamove plays and the curtain falls.",
