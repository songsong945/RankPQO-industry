        "The version shown in what were then known as neighborhood theatres (i.e. second run houses) was shorter than the full-length one by about a half hour, and the cuts were very obvious. The first cut occurred after Arthur said the line \"He lives backwards\" (referring to Merlin). In the cut version, he does not explain what it means, while in the full-length version he does. Also gone in the cut version were half of Lancelot's first song \"C'est Moi\", half of Guenevere's song \"The Simple Joys of Maidenhood\", Arthur's spoken monologue during \"How To Handle A Woman\", and the entire scene in which Arthur, in the forest, remembers the lessons that Merlin taught him as a boy. The film was subsequently re-released a year later with the tagline UNCUT!, although it turned out to be still cut in the same spots. It was not until its first telecast (in two parts, on NBC) that all the cut moments were restored.",
