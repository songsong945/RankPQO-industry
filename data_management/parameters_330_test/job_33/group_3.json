        "Originally shot in 1974 under the title 'L'uomo e il bambino', this film was shelved when one of the film financial backers died and ownership of the picture became entangled in bankruptcy proceedings before post-production had been completed, which prevented its theatrical release. The film sat on a shelf for almost 25 years until actress Lea Lander rescued it from oblivion by helping finance a DVD release: a new short prologue was shot, according to Bava's original script, and editing and scoring were completed using existing available materials.  In 2002 producer Alfredo Leone and director Lamberto Bava (Mario's son), allegedly dissatisfied with the DVD edit, produced a new restored version of the film.  Lamberto Bava and his son Roy shot additional footage and original composer Stelvio Cipriani created a new complete musical score (though the DVD release employed some of Cipriani's cues and themes, the film was never properly scored in 1974).  This restored version, produced by Kismet Entertainment Group and retitled \"Kidnapped\", premiered theatrically in the US on May 31, 2002 as part of a Mario Bava retrospective at the American Cinematheque's Egyptian Theater in Hollywood",

        "After spending many years as a banned Video Nasty the film was finally submitted to the BBFC in November 2000 in a heavily pre-cut form, removing around 6 minutes of graphic violence. These included a complete removal of cannibalism scenes, a man's eye being gouged out, a scene where Pat threatens a topless native with a knife, all shots of Mike being castrated, scalped and his hand severed, and the infamous scene where Pat is hoisted aloft with iron hooks through her breasts. All of the graphic animal cruelty was also removed. Notably a snake slowly killing a muskrat, and a leopard killing a monkey, plus the mutilations of a crocodile and a turtle. The BBFC additionally made a further 6 sec cut to a shot of a tethered muskrat falling from a jeep.",

        "Originally shot in 1974 under the title 'L'uomo e il bambino', this film was shelved when one of the film financial backers died and ownership of the picture became entangled in bankruptcy proceedings before post-production had been completed, which prevented its theatrical release. The film sat on a shelf for almost 25 years until actress Lea Lander rescued it from oblivion by helping finance a DVD release: a new short prologue was shot, according to Bava's original script, and editing and scoring were completed using existing available materials.  In 2002 producer Alfredo Leone and director Lamberto Bava (Mario's son), allegedly dissatisfied with the DVD edit, produced a new restored version of the film.  Lamberto Bava and his son Roy shot additional footage and original composer Stelvio Cipriani created a new complete musical score (though the DVD release employed some of Cipriani's cues and themes, the film was never properly scored in 1974).  This restored version, produced by Kismet Entertainment Group and retitled \"Kidnapped\", premiered theatrically in the US on May 31, 2002 as part of a Mario Bava retrospective at the American Cinematheque's Egyptian Theater in Hollywood",

        "The UK DVD distibuted by Vipco is the cut version, running 83 minutes, removing most of the gore footage. All elements of actual cannibalism ie:- the cannibals picking at the dead bodies - are removed, and when Zora Kerowa is killed, this edited version plays as though she has dissapeared, never once showing either the actual event of the aftermath of the famous \"hooks through the breasts\" death. All but one of the animal deaths are missing, and the death of the pig appears trimmed. Also cut, amongst others, is John Morghen's arm being lopped off, the 2 castration scenes, and John Morghen removing a natives eye with a knife.",
