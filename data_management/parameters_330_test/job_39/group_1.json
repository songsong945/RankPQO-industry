In particular, scenes featuring porn star Annette Haven as Dudley Moore's exhibitionist neighbor have been removed, replaced with scenes involving another actress. On scene features Moore's character using a telescope to watch a naked A. Haven making love (in the TV version, we see the substitute actress kissing a man while wearing a robe). A later scene, originally shown as a nude orgy, is replaced by a similar scene, but with everyone wearing bathing suits. In addition, the comedic lovemaking scene between Derek and Moore is played in the dark in the TV version.",
