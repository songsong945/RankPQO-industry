        "Additional material from an earlier version of episode 2 of \"Carnival Of Monsters\" was mistakenly screened in Australia in the mid 1970's. These have since been included on the DVD release. One extended scene involves a more abrupt initial confrontation with Lieutenant Andrews and a more in-depth discussion with Shirna & Vorg. The deleted scene is in the SS Bernice stateroom, and immediately followed the eradicator attack upon the scope. It was removed due to timing purposes. Early versions of episode #2 used a new version of the theme music, composed by the BBC's Radiophonic Workshop to celebrate the shows 10th anniversary. The new arrangement used the EMI Synthi 100 \"Delaware\" Synthesiser. These alternate title sequences were eventually not used for Broadcast. For the 1981 repeat, director/producer Barry Letts requested that 44 seconds of material be cut from the final episode (#4), due to Peter Halliday's bald-cap slipping in some shots. This shortened 'directors preferred' ending is also included on the DVD.",

        "The untelevised version of the series' first episode, \"An Unearthly Child\" - which was released on video in the early 1990s - contains a number of major differences from the version that was finally broadcast. These differences include: - A thunderclap is heard during the opening theme. - Susan is portrayed as more mature and sensual than she was in the final version. She is shown wearing more futuristic clothing as well. - The Doctor is portrayed almost as a villain - much more cold-hearted than he was in the TV series. - Susan says she is from the 49th Century, while The Doctor seems to imply he and Susan are lost in time. In the final version, we never learn which century Susan and The Doctor are from, and The Doctor confesses that he and Susan are exiles. - The famous TARDIS sound effect is much different in the early take. - In addition, the untelevised version contains a number of bloopers (actors flubbing lines, cameramen tripping over scenery, etc.).",
