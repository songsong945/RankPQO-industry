Butch asks, \"What if they don't follow the horse?\". Sundance: \"Don't worry, Butch, you'll think of something.\" Originally Butch retorts, \"That's a load off my mind.\" That line was kept in the movie right through the mid-'70s until it was broadcast on network TV (1976). For some reason it was omitted and has remained absent through every TV, cable, video, laserdisc and previous DVD release. It was reinstated back into the 2006 \"Ultimate Collector's Edition\" DVD and viewers are treated to it for the first time in 30 years.",
