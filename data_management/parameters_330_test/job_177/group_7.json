The re-broadcast of episode #1.04 \"Lucy Thinks Ricky Is Trying To Murder Her\" on the 13th November 1952 featured a new opening \"Flashback\" sequence which ran for just over a minute and a half. The sequence involves Lucy telling Ricky that instead of watching TV, they will read a murder mystery. Then Desi reminds Lucy what happened the last time she read a murder mystery. This leads into the opening scene of \"Lucy Thinks Ricky Is Trying To Murder Her\". This flashback scene has been restored for the 2002 DVD release of \"I Love Lucy\".",
