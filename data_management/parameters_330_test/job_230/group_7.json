The American Best Film & Video release is missing the opening speech where Fisher decides what to do about Anne and the fight with the camp, tap-dancing gang, scenes that are in the British release. However it gains 3 scenes on the British version: - A longer scene of the Riders discovering the body of Chris by the pier. - After Sandy and Speedy's cremation all the Riders take a handful of cremated ash and throw it into the river in a ritual. - A conversation between Anne and Trash on the beach, just before she is kidnapped by the Zombies, where she says she wants to leave because she feels responsible for all the deaths that have happened and Trash makes a speech about how \"death is part of life, we live with it and it's scent gets on our skin\".
