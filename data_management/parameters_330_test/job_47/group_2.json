Then they reused the scene of Serena walking down the hall (the stain on her dress is back), to fill the extra time. Suddenly, when they get to the front of the embassy, Serena is holding a pink parasol. You can see part of the cut scene in \"Day of Destiny\" when Serena is trying to get Darien to remember her. After the princess unveils the diamond, Serena says she needs a few minutes to herself. She has an empty cocktail glass in her hand and she's blushing.

When Amy realizes that she is late for computer school and abandons the Sailor V video game someone yells \"She had over 100,000 points!\" but the shot of the game screen shows a score of only 6850.

In the English version, they reused the first scene of Serena being knocked off the balcony, but played it backwards so it looks like she's being pulled up! Then they reused the scene of Serena walking down the hall (the stain on her dress is back), to fill the extra time. Suddenly, when they get to the front of the embassy, Serena is holding a pink parasol. You can see part of the cut scene in \"Day of Destiny\" when Serena is trying to get Darien to remember her. After the princess unveils the diamond, Serena says she needs a few minutes to herself. She has an empty cocktail glass in her hand and she's blushing. In the original, she decides to drink one of the cocktails, which she thinks it's juice and becomes slightly drunk. In the English version, the kiss at the end is supposed to be a dream.
