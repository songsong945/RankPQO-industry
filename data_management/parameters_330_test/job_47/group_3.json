        "CBS Television Network in the United States refused to carry the episode \"Living in Harmony\", supposedly due to its anti-war message (the hero refuses to carry a gun).  At the time CBS claimed their rejection was due to the use of hallucinogenic drugs in the plot.  While many prefer the anti-Vietnam scenario over the drug theory, several facts support CBS' version. First, they had already broadcast two episodes of entertainment series that were clearly against U.S.  involvement in southeast Asia (\"Route 66\", March 22, 1963; \"Twilight Zone\", Sept.  27, 1963). Secondly, the drugs in \"Harmony\" are quite different from those used in other \"Prisoner\" episodes. On most occasions, they have no more in common with recreational \"junk\" than truth serum as seen in more realistic spy dramas, while the plan here was to take our hero and \"fill him with hallucinotory drugs....dis-orient him\" according to the episode's dialogue. There is actually a third theory that is more likely than either of those.  \"Living In Harmony\" is not identified as a segment of \"The Prisoner\" until the end, unless you recognize star Patrick McGoohan, the parallels to \"Arrival\", and the typeface used in what credits there are (the episode title appears to be the series title).  When the program was first broadcast in the U.K., in some regions (it wasn't shown simultaneously across the country as in the U.S.) superimposed the words \"The Prisoner\" over the image at the beginning.  Star/Executive Producer/Creative driving force Patrick McGoohan reportedly didn't like this at all, but it would have forewarned him to contractually prohibit CBS from doing the same thing. According to this theory, CBS declined to air the episode rather than gamble on the intelligence of their audience.",
