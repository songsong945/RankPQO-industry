Both versions feature Brian asking Stewie to get a pair of scissors to cut the rope. In the original, Stewie agreed to do so, but warned Brian that, being a baby, he's very easily distracted. He runs off screen and we see him get distracted by a brightly colored dishrag. In the new version, Stewie refuses to get the scissors because Brian had previously tricked him into watching the infamous Internet video \"2 Girls 1 Cup\" (which is then showed in a flashback).",
