Four key scenes are still missing: - 1. Colonel Hessler and General Kohler meet Schumacher's paratroop contingent just after they leave Kohler's office. - 2. After Kohler shows Hessler the colossal war room, Hessler goes outside and inspects his tanks. - 3. After Pritchard tells Kiley he is being transferred to the United States, Kiley and Maj. Wolenski discuss what should be done with Germany after the war. - 4. The most famous missing scene occurs right after the nuns ask Hessler for aid in Ambleve. It has a young French boy attempt to assassinate Hessler. Hessler allows the boy to live, but has his father shot instead. Immediately after this scene, Major Wolenski has a meeting with Hessler in which he confronts him about the Malmedy Massacre.",
