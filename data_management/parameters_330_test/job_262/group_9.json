Grace informs Norm and Jake about it. - The squad reaches the abandoned school. It reveals that Grace teaches English to the Na'vi children until a serious incident came about (bullet holes around, etc..) which was insinuated about. - Jake and Neytiri tripping through the neon-light woods is slightly longer. - When Jake joins the circle, a little Na'vi girl smiles at him curiously, but her father holds her back. Neytiri then arrives and hands Jake a fruit. - Jake tries to ask Neytiri her name, but she seems annoyed by that. - Jake, Grace and Norm proceed from the helicopter to the secluded laboratory. There's an explanation about the mountains. - At night, Jake and Neytiri run through the luminescent forest. - After Jake touches the Fan Lizard, it flies away in a radiant glow. Its fellow species follow suit and, to the delight of Jake and Neytiri, raise themselves into the air. - As Jake and the other Na'vi climb the mountain, Neytiri flies past them on a Seze. - The Na'vi goes for an aerial hunt for Stuurmbeast. Jake shoots one and exclaims in excitement. Neytiri follow suit as well. - The Na'vi destroy the Hell Trucks of the mining company. - The next morning, Wainfleet's squad sifts through the remains of the Hell Trucks. Turns out that Na'vi kill the soldiers as well. Quaritch and Selfridge watch the live broadcast. - Tsu'tey's fall from the sky is longer.

        "The 178-minute extended version has the same additions as included in the 2010 Special Edition with the following additions and changes: - The biggest addition being the alternate opening with Jake describing life on earth. At the bar with his friends, he saves a young woman from being hit by a man by fighting him. However, he gets thrown out by the doorman at the backlane. The two men then approach him to tell him about his twin Tommy's demise and the proposal of taking over. There's a close-up of a dead Tommy slowly consumed by the incinerator fire and it morphs to Jake at the spaceship as to point out them being twins. Due to that, the close-up (serves as the bookmark of the original opening and ending) of Jake opening his eyes on the ship has been removed. - Before taking off to Pandora, an extra line of the pilot has been added: \"Copy, Venture Star. Go for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4 niner.\" - The next two additions deal more about the abandoned school scene in the Special Edition. The first one happens when Grace considers a picture of Neytiri that Jake brought out, she starts to wallow in memories. about her twin Sylwanin. She reveals her dead, obviously killed by the mercenaries as well as Norm once had a relationship with her. - The second addition: After Grace insists Jake to have a meal, he sees a picture of Grace teaching a few Na'vi at school, two of them being a young Neytiri and her twin Sylwanin. She describes what happened on the day Sylwanin was killed and how the school was abandoned. - After the marines vacate the lab and prepare for retaliation, there is an extension by Grace which obviously reveals that the marines wanted and planned for a war with the Na'vi. The small sequence that happens in the theatrical version after that was removed. - There is also the alternative Family-friendly audio track, which substitutes profanity words with a more clean words. James Cameron said in an interview that the track was included when his young son complained on hearing that accidentally while playing the movie.",

        "North American (Region 1) DVD release in 2003 features additional narration by the lead character \"Ash\" in the English dubbed version -- most notably after the pre-credits battle scene, and at the end of the film, the latter of which initially played out without any dialog. As a result of the added narration, the enigmatic ending becomes easier to understand for North American viewers. The added narration actually creates a very large problem with the 'Polish with English subtitles' option on the Region 1 DVD, since the 'traslantion' subtitles are actually dub-titles (they simply transcribed the Enlgish dub as the Polish dialog). This results in innumerable inaccuracies in the script (almost all mention of the connections to the King Arthur myth are lost on any language of the Region 1 version), and the subtitles also show up during the sequences where the English version has narration, meaning that in the middle of a dialog-less scene, the subtitles will show up anyway. Miramax has not recalled or corrected the DVD, but an uncut anamorphic version with proper subtitles is available from UK company Blue Light.",
