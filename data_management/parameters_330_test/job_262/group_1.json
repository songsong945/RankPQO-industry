In this alternate opening, Hobbes decides to bring Darien in, and attempts to put handcuffs on him, but Darien Quicksilvers and escapes, attempting to steal a car before Hobbes finally catches up to him. He forces him into the van, and they head back to The Agency, but Darien manages to convince Hobbes that the men The Agency has sent after him have no intention of bringing him back alive. They are followed, and escape into an alley. The episode then continues as it was aired, starting with the showdown in the alley where Darien hides behind the invisible dumpster.",

In order to make up for the additions of a recap of the first hour at the beginning of the second and a full second set of opening and closing titles, as well as for clearing more time for extra commercials, a significant amount of footage was excised, including all of Jack McGee's visit to Dr. Marks' home the morning after Banner's first \"Hulk-out,\" during which he, unknown to either of them, glimpsed Banner over her shoulder.",
