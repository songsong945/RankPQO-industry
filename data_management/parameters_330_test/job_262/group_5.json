        "When UK censor 'James Ferman' (qv) first saw the film in 1976 he suggested that it could be shown in licensed cinema clubs after the scene where a young boy's penis is yanked by Sada had been removed completely to comply with the Protection of Children Act. It was not officially submitted for UK cinema release until 1991 due to the film's graphic sexual nature and, although this print was fully uncut in terms of sexual footage, it featured an optical edit during the scene with the boy. Instead of removing the scene Ferman cropped off the bottom and far right of the screen, thus allowing the audience to realize the instability of Sada's character while removing the offending shot. The film first received a home video/DVD release in 2000 by Nouveaux and this print retained the optical edit, though the print itself was a shorter version and missed 6 minutes 15 secs of assorted dialogue and footage (the sexual footage remained uncut). The 2009 UK cinema reissue again featured the shorter print though this version cuts out the scene with the misbehaving child completely.",
