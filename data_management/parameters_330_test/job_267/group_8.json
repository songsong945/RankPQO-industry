        "Every episode of M*A*S*H ran longer than the normal 22 minutes we see today. Each Episode ran about 25 1/2 minuets, with shorter commercial breaks. The syndicated versions shown today edit out some parts of the episodes, and sometimes the \"missing\" footage is essential to the story. The DVD versions restore all \"missing\" footage and run the proper length (25 1/2 minutes).",
