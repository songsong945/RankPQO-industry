        "Two versions of this film were shot simultaneously. The Spanish version, Carmen la de Ronda, reflected the strict Spanish censorship of the time, and the character of Antonio (played by Jorge Mistral) and his men are presented as freedom fighters during the French occupation of Spain. (Hence, the origin of the USA title, A Girl Against Napoleon.) The French version contained more explicit sexual situations, and a couple of songs by Miss Montiel were substituted by other songs in French. But Antonio and his gang are presented just as smugglers trying to outwit the French authorities, closer to the opera's libretto, and evading the French/Spanish political conflict."
