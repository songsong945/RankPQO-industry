        "The home video release of this has a huge number of differences to the original TV version. Many of the scenes are shuffled in order and are much re-edited, and of most note is that much of the original dialogue is dubbed with especially recorded alternate versions, with much stronger swearing (including several instances of the \"f\" word) Some elements of the story (generally ones that would continue as threads in the TV series) are completely eliminated. Various differences include: - The opening credits captions are different, running slower. - A different version of the theme tune is played on the opening sequence. - Archangel discussing with the Senator the development of Airwolf (which gives much of the project's background) is much abridged. - Shots of Airwolf's on-board radar and maintanance screens are completely different. - Numerous scenes have different backing scores and sound effects. - A couple of close-ups of the photos in Hawke's cabin are of completely different photos to the original version. - For some reason, (most of) the story behind the paintings adorning the walls in Hawke's cabin is removed. - On the TV version, before Moffet and his crew head off to Libya in Airwolf, they destory a fighter jet over the desert. On the video version, there is a completely different version of the effectivley the same scene, with them destroying three figher jets over the ocean. - Asides from adding much stronger language, the video release also for some reason also changes numerous lines of dialogue. For pure example, when Hawke tells Dominic that he's got a tough mission for the pair of them, Dominic quips \"What're we gonna do, kidnap Kadaffi?\"; the TV version's \"Nothing that simple\" becomes \"No, a helicopter\". There's numerous other instances of lines of dialogue being changed. - The closing credits are (slightly) different. - The whole chunk of story of where Hawke and Dominic find a hiding place for Airwolf for after they retreive it (in a hollow mountain) and the whole last few minutes after Hawke's recovered & hidden Airwolf, and saying he'll only return it if the Firm find solid information on his missing brother, are completely gone. - The video version finishes (rather abruptly) with Hawke and Dominic having defeated Moffet, flying off over the ocean into the sun-set (in a piece of footage used on the TV episode 'Mad Over Miami') and the film finishing; as opposed to the TV version which has several more minutes with Hawke and Archangel discussing the return of Airwolf on condition that Hawke's brother is found, then Hawke going back out to the lake to play his cello. - Interestingly, there is a scene where twisted creator Dr. Moffet is torturing the kidnapped Gabrielle in the desert, that was in the original TV version but not on this release. This scene is quite strong and as a result is often edited out by many TV showings; considering the stronger nature of the video version, it's surprising it was not included. As this scene is not on the video release and is often cut out on TV, it could be considered to be quite rare",
