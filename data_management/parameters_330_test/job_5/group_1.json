The third and final FMV that was change was Chris' \"bad\" ending, which was reshot so that Chris is no longer shown smoking (SCEA reportedly forbids any \"glorification\" of tobacco use in their games, despite the fact that SCEI has no problem with them). Virgin's PC port is the only version in the US to contain all the FMV intact with the opening intro being shown in color (the original Japanese was in black & white).",

Violence Control and a Blood Color mode were also added. New sets of hidden costumes were given to both Leon and Claire replacing the previous ones. A 3rd person controller system, Auto-Aim, and Rumble and Expansion Pack support were added. Randomizer Mode which gives more replay value and difficulty, gets unlocked on the menu by completing a scenario. The Randomizer always sets different items in every new game to make it feel more brand new and unpredictable. Passwords have been changed and files have been corrected in this version.
