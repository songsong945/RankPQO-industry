Oddly enough, if you play the film with the closed captions feature (on both VHS and DVD) the dialogue will still appear at the bottom of the screen even though nobody can be heard talking. The missing dialogue is as follows: - Man: See ya, Alvin. - Boy: Hey, he ain't no paper man. - Girl: Why, don't you know him?

Later, there is a scene where Freddy's face is pulled off by Tina. This scene is also missing. - When Nancy meets Freddy for the first time, we can't see when he slices his abdomen and when Nancy puts her arm on the hot pipe. - When Rod's neck is broken by Freddy Krueger, we only see Rod looking at the \"snake\", before it kills him. - The scene where the dead Tina is talking to Nancy while snakes are coming out her dress is also cut. - Glen's famous dead scene is also cut. We only see how he is sucked in his bed. The bloody, second half is cut. - When Nancy is burning Freddy, we only see the fire reach his feet, then it cuts to Nancy calling her dad. - The scene where Freddy is killing Nancy's mother by burning her is also cut. - These changes were also made in the German video version, which has a \"not under 16 years\" rating. The uncut version is sometimes shown on Pay-Per-View and is rated \"not under 18 years.\"",
