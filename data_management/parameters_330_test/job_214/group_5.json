Director 'Peter Jackson (I)' (qv) decided to use the extra time to apply some additional spit and polish to the film, resulting in a new cut approximately seven minutes shorter than the original (97 minutes vs. 104 minutes). This cut premiered at the Toronto Film Festival and was eventually released in the U.S. (along with an emasculated, 85-minute R-rated version). Although the 104-minute version remains the most commonly seen (at least outside the U.S.), Jackson has gone on record as saying the 97-minute cut is his preferred version.",
