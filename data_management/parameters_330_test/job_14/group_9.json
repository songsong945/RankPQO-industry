These scenes are now featured on the DVD 30th Anniversary edition as \"The Lost Reels\" and include: - Missing Subplot: In \"Stripped and Strapped,\" Susan, played by Edie Sedgwick, had a friend played by Nena Thurman (mother of actress Uma Thurman) who was involved in an incestuous relationship with her brother. Scenes of them together are show in a kitchen. - Another part of the missing subplot included Susan's obsession with astrological signs and things of an other worldy nature. In the Lost Reels, scenes are shown of Susan (Edie) in a room painted wall to floor with strange astrology and hand signs, talking with Allen Ginsberg. These scenes like the incestuous brother and sister were written by Chuck Wein who was inspired by Andy Warhol, who did films about nothing, and so Wein wrote these scenes to be about nothing. - Additional unfinished footage: - Scenes of Susan (Edie) at the \"Be-In\" were originally longer and featured her climbing a rock and socializing with the hippie crowd. - Aerial shots of Manhattan, which in 1967 looked industrial and more concrete, taken in a helicopter rented from the Pan-Am building of the time. - Scenes of Nena Thurman and Susan(Edie) shop-lifting at downtown Manhattan store Paraphernalia. - Scenes of Susan(Edie) having a \"bitch fight\" with Baby Jane Holzer after Susan returns home to the Chelsea Hotel from shop-lifting at Paraphernalia. - Susan and Paul America eating sushi at one of the first sushi bars in late 60s Manhattan. - More scenes of Edie and Paul America wandering New York. Also included are some night shots of Edie at a fountain. - David Weisman was also featured in the film much longer before editing and included: Scenes of him at his home with Nena Thurman, Edie, Paul America and some friends of his getting high. David shows off his Samuri sword, apparently he had an obsession with Kurosawa films. Also a scene of David with his Manhattan \"Scenesters\" is shown. - Three dancers are shown dancing in front of Mario with a monkey. - Allen Ginsberg's appearance at the \"Medium Convention\" was origanlly much longer and featured him performing one of his monologues. - Some shots of Paul America in a car, picking up and dropping off Baby Jane Holzer at the heloport, he gets angry and takes off in the car and isn't seen again for a few years. - The only existing footage of the interior of famed Max's Kansas City was found among the reels and is featured here. - Some beautiful black and white footage of women in the cotumes/dresses of the Silver Sixties are shown at night in the cold fog. - Missing color footage included: A shot of Edie falling over while dancing in front of Butch, she spills the cup of vodka she is drinking on the mattress at the bottom of the pool.",

Although the script was never finished some of the original material from the script by Wein and Charbin was shot but ultimately cut from Ciao! Manhattan. These scenes are now featured on the DVD 30th Anniversary edition as \"The Lost Reels\" and include: - Missing Subplot: In \"Stripped and Strapped,\" Susan, played by Edie Sedgwick, had a friend played by Nena Thurman (mother of actress Uma Thurman) who was involved in an incestuous relationship with her brother. Scenes of them together are show in a kitchen. - Another part of the missing subplot included Susan's obsession with astrological signs and things of an other worldy nature. In the Lost Reels, scenes are shown of Susan (Edie) in a room painted wall to floor with strange astrology and hand signs, talking with Allen Ginsberg. These scenes like the incestuous brother and sister were written by Chuck Wein who was inspired by Andy Warhol, who did films about nothing, and so Wein wrote these scenes to be about nothing. - Additional unfinished footage: - Scenes of Susan (Edie) at the \"Be-In\" were originally longer and featured her climbing a rock and socializing with the hippie crowd. - Aerial shots of Manhattan, which in 1967 looked industrial and more concrete, taken in a helicopter rented from the Pan-Am building of the time. - Scenes of Nena Thurman and Susan(Edie) shop-lifting at downtown Manhattan store Paraphernalia. - Scenes of Susan(Edie) having a \"bitch fight\" with Baby Jane Holzer after Susan returns home to the Chelsea Hotel from shop-lifting at Paraphernalia. - Susan and Paul America eating sushi at one of the first sushi bars in late 60s Manhattan. - More scenes of Edie and Paul America wandering New York. Also included are some night shots of Edie at a fountain. - David Weisman was also featured in the film much longer before editing and included: Scenes of him at his home with Nena Thurman, Edie, Paul America and some friends of his getting high. David shows off his Samuri sword, apparently he had an obsession with Kurosawa films. Also a scene of David with his Manhattan \"Scenesters\" is shown. - Three dancers are shown dancing in front of Mario with a monkey. - Allen Ginsberg's appearance at the \"Medium Convention\" was origanlly much longer and featured him performing one of his monologues. - Some shots of Paul America in a car, picking up and dropping off Baby Jane Holzer at the heloport, he gets angry and takes off in the car and isn't seen again for a few years. - The only existing footage of the interior of famed Max's Kansas City was found among the reels and is featured here. - Some beautiful black and white footage of women in the cotumes/dresses of the Silver Sixties are shown at night in the cold fog. - Missing color footage included: A shot of Edie falling over while dancing in front of Butch, she spills the cup of vodka she is drinking on the mattress at the bottom of the pool.",
