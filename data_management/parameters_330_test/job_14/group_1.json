One can only assume this is Bean's idea of security for his apartment. - Bean and David riding around Los Angeles more - Bean and David posing for a picture at the fairgrounds - Bean taking one last picture of David before he boards the plane back home. He motions for David to move back. David backs up so much he ends ups falling over a large pile of luggage - Bean wearing sunglasses and holding a sign that reads 'Jack Nicholson'. He is obviously posing for a picture as he grins like Nicholson and points to the sign and then himself. - Bean doing a Broadway-like dance with a fedora hat on the steps outside his workplace - More shots of Bean giving the finger to everyone - Bean drinking Champagne while flying to America and then making faces after sampling some - Bean with the turkey stuck on his head actually walking outside the Langley house and nearly getting hit by a car and then falling in a bush",

        "This film was re-released in IMAX and other large format theaters on January 1, 2002. The following changes were made to the film for this release: - The \"In Association with Silver Screen Partners IV\" credit is replaced with \"The Special Edition Of--\" on the opening title sequence. The 2002 DVD omits this credit & the Walt Disney Pictures Presents credit stays on screen. - The animation in some of the scenes went back through the clean-up animation department a second time, to correct problems such as wavering lines and missing details, which, while not very noticeable during a traditional 35mm showing of the film, would have been discomforting on a much large IMAX screen. Small details, such as the blood in Beast's wound after his fight with the wolves, were also added. - The Beast's \"stutter\" (\"You wan-wanna stay in the tower?\"), a sound editing mistake, was corrected (\"You wanna stay in the tower?\"). - Six minutes of new footage was added between the songs \"Something There\" and \"Beauty and the Beast,\" most of which is made up of a new musical sequence, \"Human Again.\" This song was written by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken for the original version of the film, but cut for continuity purposes. After Alan Menken altered the song to make it work for the Broadway stage version of Beauty and the Beast, the song was worked back into the film. - During the \"Human Again\" song sequence, the household objects clean up the Beast's castle, which necessitated having the background artists go back and digitally re-paint the backgrounds for the castle scenes that followed so that the castle was clean. - The animation for Cogsworth's line to the Beast after Belle is freed (\"Yes-yes-yes, but...why?\") was completely re-done, as the directors never liked how the animation looked in the original version. - New sound effects are added to the shot where Belle and Phillippe leave the castle to find Maurice, which are supposed to suggest that the Beast trashes his room in anguish (and also so that the backgrounds from this point on would not have to be repainted). - The longer credits necessitated the addition of an additional passage of score music, the version of the 'Transformation' theme that was cut out of the original film, to the end of the film.",
