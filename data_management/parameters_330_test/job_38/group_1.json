The cut footage in the UNRATED DVD version is as follows: - When Nick fantasizes about Helena and Ray having sex we see a shot of most of Helena's butt in her thong underwear; Helena removing Ray's pants where we see part of his bare butt; Ray kissing up Helena's body where we see one of her breasts; and finally one last shot that shows Helena's breasts very briefly. - During Nick's sex scene with the fantasy woman while Helena watches, extra footage includes a scene with Nick behind the woman, then a shot of him thrusting into her, followed by several views of the woman's bare breasts.",
