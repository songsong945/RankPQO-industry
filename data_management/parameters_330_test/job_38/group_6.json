While visiting the Pentagon, Beavis can't take a dump in their restroom because there's no toilet paper in the stall. Butt-head is equally angry with Washington because the urinals don't automatically flush when you run your hand across them. After the rest of their tour bus has finished looking at an encased Declaration of Independence, Beavis sneaks out, breaks the glass and snatches it to use as \"T.P. for his bunghole.\" While Pentagon guards rush to see what happened, Beavis cleans up and exits the stall with a piece of the Declaration, containing John Hancock's signature, stuck to his shoe.",
