        "A version shown on UK channel ITV-1 was cut: most of the fight between the Joker and Phantasm is edited out. When Joker sprays Phantasm with his flower, in the unedited version she takes off the glove he hits pushes Joker into a table where he reaches between the large sausage and a knife, and grabs the large sausage. He then runs past her, and escapes by running through a window. In the edied version, he sprays her glove and then escapes through the window. The table fight is completly removed."

        "Reportedly, the South Korean VHS edition of \"Batman Returns\" remains infamous between Korean audiences because of its stupid cut by the video company: the movie runs 126m., but in order to put in on a 120m. cassette, the company cut the whole sequence of Selina's transformation to Catwoman.  In theaters, it was intact."
