The US DVD release was also heavily cut for an R rating with appreciably different cuts to the UK version which turns out to be the most complete. In the opening scene where Sweet (Matthias Hues) attacks a group of thugs the UK version is the most complete. In the UK version when Hues lifts up and head-butts a thug the camera pans down the thugs face revealing blood pouring from his mouth. In the US DVD the scene cuts away before the camera reaches his mouth. The DVD is also missing several punches to the next thugs ribs. The thug lying on the bed who gets his arm broken is cut identically in both versions. The scene where Dillon (Don Wilson) enters the dead prostitutes room is cut in the UK version. In the DVD we see a close up shot of the woman lying on the bed which is cut from the UK tape. The scene where the thugs attack Shanna's house is cut on the DVD. The knife wielding thug that attacks Dillon get his arm broken in the UK tape before he is thrown through the table. On the DVD the arm break is missing. The scene where Sweet attacks the two men on the street has been cut for the UK version. We should see Sweet lift up the first thug and head-butt him but this is missing from the UK tape (but surprisingly a photo of that exact scene is printed on the back of the tape). The scene where Sweet kills Dillons partner is cut on both versions. Close up punches to the face have been cut from the UK version. Sweet breaking the mans neck has been cut differently on both versions. In the UK version Sweet grabs the mans head and says 'Time to...' but the remaining dialogue (presumably 'Time to die') is missing and the man is lying on the floor with his neck broken. The DVD is also missing the neck break but all of the 'Time to die' dialogue is also missing. The final martial arts scene in Dillon's apartment has been cut differently in both versions. All scenes showing Nunchaku sticks have been cut from the UK version. Various snippets of martial arts have been cut from both versions. The scene showing Sweet impaled on a sword has been cut from the DVD. In the UK version the camera pans down showing Sweet staggering about with the sword impaled through his chest and blood pouring from his mouth.
