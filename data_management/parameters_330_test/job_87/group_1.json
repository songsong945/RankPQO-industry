Wendy leaves Danny to get some food, and Danny tells her that he called to Dick.

The ghost vanishes, and Jack then appears to \"punish\" him. - A climatic ballroom scene in which the \"party guests\" and the orchestra all melt in gruesome fashion. - An outtake featuring orchestra conductor Gage Creed (played by 'Stephen King (I)' (qv)) melting in gruesome fashion.",

        "In the episode \"The Tale of Two Springfields\" Homer threatens to blow himself up with the dynamite strapped to his chest. When it doesn't detonate he tells Bart \"Nice wiring Bart\" to which Bart responds \"Worked on the test corpse\". The original line was \"Worked on the test goat\". When the FOX version is played with the closed captioning running, the original line appears in the text even though what we hear is \"corpse\". Plus it is plain to see that Bart's mouth movements don't match the word \"corpse\".",
