This includes two excellent scenes cut from every version of the movie. At the beginning, as Arthur yells \"To the pit!\" the little bald guy with the whip (Gold Tooth) says \"To the pit with the blackguard!\" and charges Ash on his horse. Ash knocks him off the horse with his shotgun and is sucker-punched by Arthur, which Ash doesn't like, and knocks Arthur down. Arthur is shocked, but recovers to slap Ash's face lightly and order his men to \"Secure the prisoner.\" They do.  Another scene explains the mirror thing a little better, as Ash leaves the windmill to walk through an ominous forest, accidentally knocking into his horse. Saying \"You big piece of hamburger, c'mere,\" he ties the horse down until seeing a duplicate of himself in the windmill's doorway, which then slams shut. He runs back into the windmill and smashes headfirst into a mirror. These scenes are included in VERY rough scratched-up form in the \"director's cut\" DVD/VHS, along with another scene in which Ash is captured by Henry's men, including Rob Tapert. Henry stops them from killing Ash and laughs, calling Ash \"Mr. Fancypants.\" Ash convinces Henry to fight with him, saying \"You owe me.\" There is also an alternate opening on the DVD which is much more horror-like, omitting the S-Mart material and including more \"Evil Dead 2\"-style footage. This matches with the \"end of the world\" ending, as Ash appears to have a beard (only his eyes are shown to avoid giving this away too much).",
