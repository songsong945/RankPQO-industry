The restoration team created a still-photo recreation to include as a supplement; it has appeared on most home video versions of the 139-minute cut. Because it was done on tape and because it was decided audiences might find the switch from live action to still photos jarring, it was left out of the film's reconstruction. The \"Film Facts\" supplement of the 30th Anniversary DVD claims it was there, but the BBFC's listing for the film, dated August 11, 1971, lists its running time as 117 minutes, 5 seconds.

        "There is one still-missing song that is missing that was intended to be in the film, entitled \"A Step in the Right Direction.\" It would have occurred after Miss Price opened her package and found a broomstick. Disney could not locate any film footage of this number, but they found the audio tracks and still photographs of the number. The restoration team created a still-photo recreation to include as a supplement; it has appeared on most home video versions of the 139-minute cut. Because it was done on tape and because it was decided audiences might find the switch from live action to still photos jarring, it was left out of the film's reconstruction. The \"Film Facts\" supplement of the 30th Anniversary DVD claims it was there, but the BBFC's listing for the film, dated August 11, 1971, lists its running time as 117 minutes, 5 seconds. The song sequence itself is 2 minutes, 30 seconds, making it unlikely that the premiere screening had the song.",

        "The following scenes were never shown in theaters, video, or DVD; only on television: - Ted removing his jacket to use it as a cover for the puppies he and Emily were placing in a cardboard box. - Ted and Emily are trapped in the apartment garage (where Regina and Floyd reside), so they try to open the garage door by stepping on a wire that opens it, but to no avail. However, Beethoven chews on the wire, which causes the garage to open. - After George Newton finds out about the puppies, the next scene shows him stapling fliers on each tree saying \"Puppies for sale\", while Emily secretly takes them off one-by-one, then attempts to potty-train them next to a hydrant, but it becomes very difficult for him. - The Newtons were packing all of their belongings and gear into their car before leaving their house. - After the McDonald's scene, the Newtons are singing car songs. - During the stay at their lake house, Ted secretly picks out air fresheners from the local convenience store. - Emily telling her mom that she taught their puppy Tchaikovsky, but he doesn't really follow her at all afterwards. - At Taylor's party, it shows Beethoven struggling to get free from the support beam, with the glass bottles shown shaking frequently. Although the scene where the three party guys are shown pouring beer onto Beethoven is edited out (but not in the final cut of the film). - During The fair scene when George is eating the kids show up to take him to the eating contest with Beethoven,the scene originally ends with George saying \"What kind of a contest is it where you just sit?\" however there is an extended version which shows them walking away with Ted saying \"C'mon Dad\" - After George's nightmare sequence of a lot of puppies in his living room, the Newton family's commercial airs on their TV and they all begin to watch it. The difference here (compared to the final cut of the film) is that once the doorbell rang (after the commercial), Ryce stands up quickly from the couch and answers the door, instead of her shouting, \"I'll get it!\"",
