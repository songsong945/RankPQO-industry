Each episode was fully restored visually by Gainax as part of an Evangelion renewal project, cleaning up and slightly lengthening the animation in each episode. Also, the original stereo sound mix for both the Japanese and English language versions were remixed into 5.1 surround sound. Additionally, bits of dialogue in the English language version were rerecorded. Specific examples of this include references Misato makes to \"brain damage\" that are replaced with \"mental contamination\" in order to correct a translation error in the original dub, and the dialogue played over the episode previews was completely redone to fit their revised lengths.",
