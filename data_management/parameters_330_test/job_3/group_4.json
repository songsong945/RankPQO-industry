        "The dialogue from the film playing inside the movie theater when Alice first walks in and sits down can be heard in the original theatrical version and on earlier VHS editions but the dialogue has been dubbed out from New Line Cinema's most recent releases on both VHS and DVD so that you can only hear the background piano music instead. Oddly enough, if you play the film with the closed captions feature (on both VHS and DVD) the dialogue will still appear at the bottom of the screen even though nobody can be heard talking. The missing dialogue is as follows: - Man: See ya, Alvin. - Boy: Hey, he ain't no paper man. - Girl: Why, don't you know him? That's \"Hot Fingers\" Curly. - Boy: Boy, he really swings out hoppin' with a jive. You want to dance? - Girl: Do I?",
