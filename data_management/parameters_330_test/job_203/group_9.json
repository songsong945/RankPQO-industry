        "In 2007, a Director's Cut version of the film was released containing 1 minute 41 seconds of new footage: - In the theatrical release, when Arius ('Dan Hedaya' (qv)) tells Jenny ('Alyssa Milano' (qv)) that Matrix is cooperating and asks her if it would be nice to see him again, she responds \"Not nearly as nice as watching him smash your face in.\" In the Director's Cut, she says, \"Not nearly as nice as watching him kick your ass.\" - During the scene where Matrix and Cindy ('Rae Dawn Chong' (qv)) follow Sully ('David Patrick Kelly' (qv)) from the airport to the shopping mall, there is an extra scene where she asks him his name and what he does for a living. - After Matrix has killed Sully, there is a short scene of Arius, Bennett and Jenny arriving in Val Verde, followed by a scene of Matrix explaining to Cindy what's going on. In the Director's Cut, this scene runs longer, with Cindy asking Matrix about Jenny's mother, who Matrix says died in childbirth. He then laments how he has missed all the important moments of her life due to his work around the world. Cindy asks him why he had to do so much traveling, and what he did, to which he replies, \"Things you don't want to know about. Things that sometimes I wish I didn't know about. But that part of my life is over with, all that matters to me now is Jenny.\" - The tool-shed scene is longer, and contains several very brief new shots of soldiers being killed in various ways. Included amongst the new material is a brief close up of a rake piercing a soldier's belly, a shot of a saw-blade slicing a soldier's neck, a shot of the soldier who is hit in the groin with the axe grimacing in pain, and a shot of the soldier touching the stump of his arm after Matrix has cut it off."

        "In 2007, a Director's Cut version of the film was released containing 1 minute 41 seconds of new footage: - In the theatrical release, when Arius ('Dan Hedaya' (qv)) tells Jenny ('Alyssa Milano' (qv)) that Matrix is cooperating and asks her if it would be nice to see him again, she responds \"Not nearly as nice as watching him smash your face in.\" In the Director's Cut, she says, \"Not nearly as nice as watching him kick your ass.\" - During the scene where Matrix and Cindy ('Rae Dawn Chong' (qv)) follow Sully ('David Patrick Kelly' (qv)) from the airport to the shopping mall, there is an extra scene where she asks him his name and what he does for a living. - After Matrix has killed Sully, there is a short scene of Arius, Bennett and Jenny arriving in Val Verde, followed by a scene of Matrix explaining to Cindy what's going on. In the Director's Cut, this scene runs longer, with Cindy asking Matrix about Jenny's mother, who Matrix says died in childbirth. He then laments how he has missed all the important moments of her life due to his work around the world. Cindy asks him why he had to do so much traveling, and what he did, to which he replies, \"Things you don't want to know about. Things that sometimes I wish I didn't know about. But that part of my life is over with, all that matters to me now is Jenny.\" - The tool-shed scene is longer, and contains several very brief new shots of soldiers being killed in various ways. Included amongst the new material is a brief close up of a rake piercing a soldier's belly, a shot of a saw-blade slicing a soldier's neck, a shot of the soldier who is hit in the groin with the axe grimacing in pain, and a shot of the soldier touching the stump of his arm after Matrix has cut it off."
