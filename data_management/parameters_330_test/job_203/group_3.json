This was toned down to Clyde just shooting the butcher, and finally just pistol whipping him. In real life, speculation still exists as to whether 'Clyde Barrow' (qv) actually committed the crime this is based on; although his photo was picked out, the method in which it was executed doesn't fit his MO. In the final cut, there is a brief jump in the film during the fight, where it was spliced from the original, more graphic conclusion. - After picking up C.W., Clyde and Bonnie take him to a diner where they plan their next robbery. - After Clyde kills Doyle Johnson (the man on the running board), Bonnie talks with CW in the bathroom while Clyde cleans his guns and laments his actions. In the bathroom CW bathes and Bonnie attempts to seduce him, but changes her mind when CW proves to be less than romantic material. A still from this scene-- Bonnie wearing a slip and Clyde's hat-- can be seen on the DVD. - A longer scene of Buck and Blanche's approach to the motor lodge. Buck is singing Bible hymns and Blanche scolds him for bringing her to see Clyde. - A longer version of Bonnie's visit home; she sits in the car and her sister gives her a perm (a portion of this-- Bonnie on the running board getting her hair put up-- exists in the final film). - A very long sequence in which Bonnie and Clyde get drunk and come to terms with their impending death. They trash their room and rip out the mattress from their bed, turning it into a makeshift coffin. They then put on their best clothes and put makeup on each other so they can see what they will look like when they're dead. The scene concludes with Bonnie and Clyde dancing around CW by candlelight and chanting \"The Hearse Song.\" - During the Platte City raid, C.W. uses a machine gun to attack the armored car instead of grenades. - The final shootout, in it's earliest form, was done entirely with still photos shown over sounds of machine gun fire and screams, and we never actually saw Bonnie or Clyde dead. The movie ended with the two farmers running towards the car while \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\" Played in the background."

        "The local Korean version of this film is approximately 90 seconds longer than the International release; a sequence was removed near the end of the film (at about the 100-minute point). This is reflected in the DVD releases, as the Tartan R2 (UK) release and the Columbia/Tristar R1 (USA) release use the International cut of the film, while the Bitwin R3 (Korean) DVD uses the original cut."
