However, all current prints do not show us what happens to Linus...in the uncut version, Linus crashes into a Coca-Cola sign (indicating the show's sponsor). Also, after the final credits (while the Peanuts gang sing \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing\"), there is a subtitle that says \"Merry Christmas from your local Coca-Cola bottler\". Due to subsequent FCC laws precluding sponsor plugs in the context of children's programs, these two elements have been edited out of all current prints (even in the so-called \"uncut\" versions shown over the past three years on CBS, as well as all home video releases from Paramount and Warner Bros.)."
