Sailor Moon did not turn into her own mother, she turned into her future self Neo-Queen Serenity. The English version omits the true nature of the Silver Crystal.

That is why Tuxedo Mask and the others are upset that Serena (as Neo-Queen Serenity) is going to use the full power of the Crystal. Similarily, Rini/Chibi-Usa risks her own life by using the Crystal from the future. In fact, both girls do use their full power. What really happens in the scene in which Sailor Moon and Rini are floating against the pink hazy background is that the voice of the original Queen Serenity comes to them and says that since the greatest wish each of them had in their hearts was to save the other, they will both be restored to life, through the powers of the present and future Silver Crystals. In the original, Usagi and Chibi-Usa did not cry when they were saying goodbye to each other in the park. Rini is actually smiling."
