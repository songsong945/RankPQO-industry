        "There are 3 hidden outtakes on the Director's Edition DVD: A scene where Penny Lane is saying Russell's girlfriend's name over and over again to get over the discomfort of it. Notice in the film Penny says she can't even say her name. Crowe says it was based on Truffaut's \"Stolen Kisses\". The clip of the shooting of the scene on the tour bus when Penny tells William that when they go to Morocco they'll have different names. The first take of the scene with William and Lester Bangs walking up the street. Crowe explains beforehand on the audio clip that when Phillip Seymour Hoffman broke character during the take he thought he heard somebody say \"cut\" when in fact nobody did.",

The cuts were waived in 1991 when the certificate was raised to a 15, and all subsequent releases are fully uncut.",

These edits appear only within the live-action interludes, a full 10 minutes worth though - this version is 75min run time. Interesting what they chose to remove, considering that much of the animation itself could be seen by some as rather risqu\u00e9 and probably intended for an adult audience. The removed bits generally are those containing abuse by the conductor upon the orchestra and animator. This is the version that was theatrically released in the U.S..

William introduces the song by saying that it was based on the works of Tolkien. During the song, the group is looking through the lyrics on the inner sleeve and a copy of Rolling Stone. William and Darryl are lip-synching and playing air guitar and drums. Elaine denounces the song, and the scene continues with her saying \"no, no, no, no\" before finally agreeing to let her go. However, rights problems forced Crowe to cut the scene. The scene is presented on the \"Bootleg Cut\" two-DVD set. The scene has no music, but there is an on-screen cue telling the viewer when to start the song.",
