The pit stop sequence before Tiger, Indigo and Anderson get to the truck stop has been deleted. Additional sounds were added (previously just music was heard) for end scene.  Last shot immediately cuts to black instead of holding on image. This version is the director's preferred cut and has replaced the first cut. It has assumed the original title of \"American Rural West\"",
