The unrated version shows Jim's father catching him laying on top of the pie on the bar in the kitchen. - Kevin ejaculating into the cup happens onscreen in the unrated version, whereas it happens off-screen in the R-rated version. - An extra, more explicit shot of Kevin and the cup of beer. In the unrated version, the cup with semen in it is clear. In the R-rated version, the cup is opaque. - More graphic pages from \"The Sex Bible\". - More moaning from Vicki while Kevin puts the Bible to use. - Approximately 5 more seconds of Nadia pleasuring herself on Jim's bed.",
