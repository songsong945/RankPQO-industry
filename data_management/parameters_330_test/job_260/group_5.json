The 60-minute episodes were edited down to 30 minute packages, with major edits to some of the 30-40 minute segments of the original shows. In cases of segments that were only 15-20 minutes in length, these were padded out by adding stock footage, newly shot scenes, and footage from Hollywood movies such as _Silent Running (1972)_ (qv) and _Fahrenheit 451 (1966)_ (qv). Most musical cues were also replaced for syndication. In order to augment \"Night Gallery\"'s syndicated run, episodes of _\"The Sixth Sense\" (1972)_ (qv) were edited down to 30 minutes, had new introductions by Rod Serling tacked on, and were added to the syndicated run of \"Night Gallery.\"",
