However, when the opening theme begins, the footage continues for another moment, showing an actual explosion. This was replaced with the more common cartoon stars exploding when the home videos first became available, and it is the cartoon stars version that was incorporated into the new dvd release. Furthermore, for the TV movie only, the opening credits show the cartoon Wonder Woman leap into a blank panel, deflect bullets and knock out the attackers with a roundhouse punch! This is the same panel which was changed to show her twirling the lasso instead. Both the live explosion and the cartoon bullet-deflecting scenes were broadcast when the TV movie aired in syndication in the 1980s, but they've never been included in the home-video versions.",
