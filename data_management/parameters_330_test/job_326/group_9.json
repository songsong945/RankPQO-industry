Shots of this ending are included in the movie storybook. It had Wadsworth as the solo killer of the bunch, explaining that he killed everyone out of the need for perfection in the world, that all of life's consistencies were not good enough, and further tells the six 'victims' that he has poisoned the champagne he served and unless they find an antidote in three hours, they'll die. Police show up soon enough and trap Wadsworth, but not for long. He gets away from the chief and leaves, locking all the people in the mansion. But as he steals a police car, he notices a 'smell' (the dog dropping smell from the beginning of the film) and realizes the Doberman from earlier is now in the police car, and it lunges for him. The police car crashes, and Wadsworth is dead. This implies that the others got out okay now that the windows were not guarded by the Doberman any longer.",

Shots of this ending are included in the movie storybook. It had Wadsworth as the solo killer of the bunch, explaining that he killed everyone out of the need for perfection in the world, that all of life's consistencies were not good enough, and further tells the six 'victims' that he has poisoned the champagne he served and unless they find an antidote in three hours, they'll die. Police show up soon enough and trap Wadsworth, but not for long. He gets away from the chief and leaves, locking all the people in the mansion. But as he steals a police car, he notices a 'smell' (the dog dropping smell from the beginning of the film) and realizes the Doberman from earlier is now in the police car, and it lunges for him. The police car crashes, and Wadsworth is dead. This implies that the others got out okay now that the windows were not guarded by the Doberman any longer.",
