        "The UK cinema release was cut by the BBFC in order to get an \"A\" rating by editing out the word \"fucking\" in the scene where James Caan holds the doctor at gunpoint (Elliott Gould's later use of the word was not present in the cinema print) and closeups of men's bloody faces during the assault on Arnhem. The cuts were restored in the 15-rated video and DVD versions."
