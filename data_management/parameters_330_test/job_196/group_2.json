        "The versions of the episodes that aired originally on Nickelodeon (from 1993-1995, the show's original run) had Dee Baker (just as himself, not in character as Olmec) doing the prize announcements. The repeats that aired years later (including those on Nick GaS) have some of these segments redone with \"later released\" prizes, and feature the voice of another announcer (probably Doc Holliday, the Double Dare announcer.) However the Temple Prize segments still have Dee Baker's voice."

Maxagaze is known as Nasty Max in US prints. Seskapile is known as Sleazy-Phil, because Nickelodeon thought the original name sounded a little perverted."
