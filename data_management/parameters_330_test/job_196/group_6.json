        "These uncut scenes are also featured in the Australian DVD and VHS The European release is much more explicit than the American release (which had to be submitted seven times to the MPAA in order to avoid an NC-17 rating). The European version is also available unrated on video in the US and on video and DVD in Australia with an R18+ Rating. The US version uses alternate, less explicit takes of several scenes to tone down the sex content. - The murder of Johnny Boz in the opening scene is more graphic; we see the killer stabbing him in his neck, stabbing him repeatedly in the chest, in the face and we see the icepick passing through his nose. - The scene where Nick almost rapes Beth is severely cut in the US version (we see ripping off her underwear and forcing her over the couch, then there's a cut to the two of them lying in bed). In the uncut version Nick pulls down his pants, penetrates Beth from behind and she has an orgasm. - The scene where Nick and Catherine make love after going to the disco is longer much more explicit in the uncut version (Nick is seen burying his face between her legs). - The death of Nick's partner, Gus, in the elevator is more graphic. The US version omits shots of Gus being repeatedly stabbed in the neck with blood and gore flying at the camera."

        "In the UK the film was originally cut for both cinema and by a further 35 secs for video by the censors who removed the following: - The scene where Duane watches a kung-fu film is missing shots of 'chain-sticks' from the kung-fu film itself. - The second doctor's death scene is missing a shot of him spitting blood as well as the climatic shot of blood splashing on his face. - The death of the female vet shortens shots of Belial clawing her face, the terminating shot of the scene showing the vet with scalpels sticking in her face is deleted. - Shots of the noisy neighbour being clawed to death by Belial are cut; this sequence was originally intercut with two other scenes making the editing at this point awful due to these cuts. - The infamous scene where Belial 'romances' Duane's girlfriend is the worst to suffer cuts- after she wakes up the entire scene has been removed bar a brief shot of her being strangled. In addition the shot of Belial on top her dead body and Duane's attempts to pull him off her is missing. Its worth noting that apart from the opening scene every murder in the film was cut to some degree by the UK censors. The 1999 Tartan release finally saw the film passed fully uncut by the BBFC."
