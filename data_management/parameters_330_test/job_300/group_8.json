In the director's cut, Champ says \"I woke up this morning and I shit a squirrel. The hell of it is, the damn thing's still alive. So I've got this shit covered squirrel down there in the office, and I don't know what to name it.\" Brick replies, \"I'm sorry, I think I ate your chocolate squirrel\". - The scene of Ron Burgundy walking around the office with an erection is extended by about fifteen seconds. - Ron daydreams of being married to Veronica, and has two children. After coming home from work, she appears from the kitchen in negligee, tells him that she's just prepared dinner in the nude, and they somewhat violently make out in the hallway. - The scene of Ron being carried away by the crowd after reading the phrase \"Go fuck yourself, San Diego\" on the air is extended, with Ron screaming, \"I would never say fuck! I would never fucking ever fucking say that!\" - After the above, Ron goes to Tino's where he is forced to eat cat poop in regards to the above incident.",
