Esteban's run in the city to the tavern is shorter, but an additional overhead shot is shown. The scene in which Pedro and Sancho are telling the story about the city of gold is shortened (they don't talk about how the patrons of the bar should invest in their adventure.) There is an additional scene of Esteban looking shocked when the official says \"find him and you'll receive a whole piece of gold.\" There is a scene difference in when Mendoza is waiting for Esteban at the dock, he waits longer, but Esteban's run to meet him is shorter. The ending of Episode 1 is omitted in that Esteban discovers Zia only.

Esteban's run in the city to the tavern is shorter, but an additional overhead shot is shown. The scene in which Pedro and Sancho are telling the story about the city of gold is shortened (they don't talk about how the patrons of the bar should invest in their adventure.)

The Episode ends right here, and the entire footage in the English/French versions of Mendoza swimming from the sharks is gone. - Some of the scenes from Episode 4 alternate ending and the rescue can be seen in the English/French version Previous and To Follow segments - Episode 5: This starts where the English/French Episode 4 ends at the raft on the island. There is a scene omission of Zia lifting her dress to sit down. This Episode ends right where Tao points the crossbow at Esteban. - Episode 6: Starts in the tree house right where Episode 5 left off, and has a small scene of Mendoza Pedro and Sancho arriving on the raft. From this point forward all Episodes are in Synch with the English/French versions, with very few differences. - Episode 9: Starts with an additional second of footage zoomed in on the Solaris's sail - Episode 27: Has a second of footage containing a lightning bolt omitted at the start of the Episode - Episode 29: In the Japanese version when Esteban Tao and Zia are struck by the Olmec ray, Esteban spins around much slower and the background isn't changed as much. - Closing Credits: There is an additional bit of animation used of the sun and then transitioning to Esteban's face - None of the previous, to follows, or live action documentaries are on the Japanese DVD's",
