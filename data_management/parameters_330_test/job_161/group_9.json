About 2 minutes and 40 seconds of cuts had been made to the BBFC version, including: - 13 seconds cut from opening sequence showing a dead man's mutilated and decomposing body in a cupboard. - 73 seconds cut from opening sequence showing several men graphically exploding after tampering with alien pods. Footage includes facial explosions and several scientists exploding at the gut in lingering slow-motion. - 19 seconds cut from warehouse sequence showing criminals exploding at the gut after unwisely standing amongst alien pods. - 2 seconds cut from warehouse sequence in which remains of freshly-exploded men are shown. - 9 seconds cut from climax, in which man's head is devoured by queen alien. - 11 seconds cut from climax showing a scientist exploding at the gut after being shot by Ian McCulloch. - 33 seconds cut from climax showing chief villain's chest exploding in slow-motion viscera-launch spectacle. The film was finally granted an uncut 15-rated certificate in the UK in 2004.",
